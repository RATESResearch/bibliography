The goal of HydroShare is to enable scientists to easily discover and access hydrologic data and models, retrieve them to their desktop or perform analyses in a distributed computing environment that may include grid, cloud or high performance computing model instances as necessary. Scientists may also publish outcomes (data, results or models) into HydroShare, using the system as a collaboration platform for sharing data, models and analyses. HydroShare is expanding the data sharing capability of the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System by broadening the classes of data accommodated, creating new capability to share models and model components, and taking advantage of emerging social media functionality to enhance information about and collaboration around hydrologic data and models. In an information system such as HydroShare, the way that information is represented, and exposed to programming interfaces, is fundamental in enhancing the functionality that can be supported. One of the fundamental concepts in HydroShare is that of a resource. In HydroShare, a resource serves, as the basic unit of content. The Resource Data Model supports specification of metadata common to all resources as well as creation of metadata and content specific to particular types of resources. Metadata are split into science and system metadata and are packaged in a format compatible with existing data repositories, such as DataOne. HydroShare resource types include different data types used in the hydrology community and also models and workflows. Another fundamental concept in HydroShare is that of a Party, representing a person or organization that may be a resource creator or contributor, or a system user or group with access privileges for resources. This paper describes the resource centric approach being used, presents the data models for resources and parties, and discusses the application programming interface functions used as a foundational interface layer in the architecture of the system for accessing resources.},

Water resources web apps fall outside of the capabilities of standard web development software, because of their spatial data components. These spatial data needs can be addressed using a combination of existing free and open source software (FOSS) for geographic information systems (FOSS4G) and FOSS for web development. However, the abundance of FOSS projects that are available can be overwhelming to new developers. In an effort to understand the web of FOSS features and capabilities, we reviewed many of the state-of-the-art FOSS software projects in the context of those that have been used to develop water resources web apps published in the peer-reviewed literature in the last decade (2004–2014).},

(CUAHSI) hydrologic information system (HIS) is a widely-used service oriented system for time series data management. While this system is intended to empower the hydrologic sciences community with better data storage and distribution, it lacks support for the kind of `Web 2.0˝ collaboration and social-networking capabilities being used in other fields. This paper presents the design, development, and testing of a software extension of CUAHSI's newest product, HydroShare. The extension integrates the existing CUAHSI HIS into HydroShare's social hydrology architecture. With this extension, HydroShare provides integrated HIS time series with efficient archiving, discovery, and retrieval of the data, extensive creator and science metadata, scientific discussion and collaboration around the data and other basic social media features. HydroShare provides functionality for online social interaction and collaboration while the existing HIS provides the distributed data management and web services framework. The extension is expected to enable scientists to access and share both national- and lab-scale hydrologic time series datasets in a standards-based web services architecture combined with social media functionality developed specifically for the hydrologic sciences.The final version of this paper will be published as part of a Special Issue “Online Water Data Networks: methods, standards, tools, and technologies”, which will be published in early 2016.},

	abstract = {Stimulating Active Learning in Hydrology Using Research-Driven, Web- based Learning ModulesThe traditional approach to undergraduate hydrology and water resource education is textbookbased and relies on idealized examples of specific engineering applications and unit processes,rather than examining the contextual relations in the processes and the dynamics connectingclimate and ecosystems. Recent research advances in hydrology have resulted in newobservational settings, instrumentation, modeling techniques and hydro-informatics and datasharing technologies. This study seeks to address the needed paradigm shift in undergraduateeducation of engineering hydrology and water resources education to reflect parallel advances inresearch and technology.This paper presents a set of learning modules that are case-based, data and simulation driven anddelivered via a web user interface. The modules are based on real-world case studies from threeregional scale ecosystems, Coastal Louisiana, Florida Everglades, and Utah Great Salt LakeBasin. These three hydro-systems provide concepts and scenarios provide unique learningopportunities on topics such as regional-scale budget analysis, hydrologic effects of human andnatural changes, climate-hydrology teleconnections and water resource management scenarios(see next page for graphical illustration). The overall theme of the coastal Louisiana modules isin coastal restoration and the impacts of future restoration/protection engineering projects on theecosystem and the ecological and economical services it provides. The Utah Great Salt LakeBasin modules include concepts related to snowmelt driven ecosystems, terminal lakewatersheds, and flood prevention. The Florida Everglades modules cover processes that connectthe hydrology of the ecosystem to large-scale climatic teleconnections and implications for waterand ecological resource management. Each learning module is a self-contained case-studyfocusing on a real-world problem. Each module begins with an introduction to theengineering/environmental problem at hand, and then presents an investigation of the basicfeatures of the hydrologic setting and its main characteristics. The module then takes the studentsthrough an investigative process of the different solutions proposed for the problem and asks theto examine different design alternatives using data analysis, as well as model simulations. Insome cases, the students setup and run their own computer models, and in other cases they useresults from a pre-run set of simulations. To promote active learning, each module has a set ofstudent-focused activities with specific tasks and deliverables. The use of observational andexperimental data augment the use of simulation data and lead to an appreciation of the naturalvariability of hydrologic processes and the difficulties associated with using models to representsuch complex systems. The place-based nature of the modules and the hands-on active learningactivities provide a real-world context, stimulate student learning, and provide a resource for thedevelopment of practical skills as well as knowledge fundamental to engineering practice.Module effectiveness is assessed through an improvement-focused evaluation model using amixed-method research approach guiding data collection. Both qualitative and quantitative dataare collected through student learning data, product analysis, stakeholder surveys, and staffinterviews. The paper presents evaluation of program fidelity, effectiveness, student learning,and potential for adaptation.

	abstract = {The mapped rivers and streams of the contiguous United States are available in a geographic information system (GIS) dataset called National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus). This hydrographic dataset has about 3 million river and water body reaches along with information on how they are connected into networks. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS) provides streamflow observations at about 20 thousand gauges located on the NHDPlus river network. A river network model called Routing Application for Parallel Computation of Discharge (RAPID) is developed for the NHDPlus river network whose lateral inflow to the river network is calculated by a land surface model. A matrix-based version of the Muskingum method is developed herein, which RAPID uses to calculate flow and volume of water in all reaches of a river network with many thousands of reaches, including at ungauged locations. Gauges situated across river basins (not only at basin outlets) are used to automatically optimize the Muskingum parameters and to assess river flow computations, hence allowing the diagnosis of runoff computations provided by land surface models. RAPID is applied to the Guadalupe and San Antonio River basins in Texas, where flow wave celerities are estimated at multiple locations using 15-min data and can be reproduced reasonably with RAPID. This river model can be adapted for parallel computing and although the matrix method initially adds a large overhead, river flow results can be obtained faster than with the traditional Muskingum method when using a few processing cores, as demonstrated in a synthetic study using the upper Mississippi River basin.

The design provided a means of growing a biomass which preferentially metabolizes high molecular weight polynuclear aromatics. The design provided controlled contact between the emulsion and bacteria and an electronic means of measuring the rate of emulsion separation. The process was used to evaluate the rate of separation of an emulsion which was contacted with bacteria. A sample of the emulsion was also evaluated as a blank, with no bacterial contact. The emulsion separated faster when contacted by the bacteria.},

	abstract = {A flocculent particle transport model was developed to aid in the assessment of particle mediated transport of pollutants in aquatic environments. The model included flocculation driven by binary inter-particle collisions and aggregate breakup driven by particle erosion. A framework was developed in conjunction with the predictive model to synthesize experimental data into the unknown model parameters. The basis of the method lies in the minimization of the variation between model predictions and observations via the iterative numerical determination of the functional minima of a residual function with respect to the parameters being determined. Model parameters have been estimated successfully for analytical and numerical solutions to dispersive, advective-dispersive and flocculent particle transport model equations. The effect of sampling or measurement error and initial parameter estimates on algorithm performance has been evaluated. This approach has been successfully applied to determine data requirements and constraints (quantity, quality and location) for measurement of hydrodynamic and transport characteristics of dye clouds and cohesive aquatic particles in laboratory mixed settling columns. A sensitivity analysis on limited particle size category resolution indicates that particle water column residence times may be significantly overestimated using distributions of less than 8 categories. A computer automated mixed settling column, designed to characterize the vertical transport of suspended particulate material in turbulent aquatic environments, was constructed to verify and calibrate the flocculent transport model within the parameter estimation framework. Dye studies were conducted for hydrodynamic characterization of the column. Continuous transmissometer data taken at various depths in the column were used to extract dispersion coefficients from the dispersive transport model coupled to the parameter estimation framework. Non-flocculent silica particles between 0.5 and 40μm in diameter were used for advection dominant transport studies and column verification. Particle transport studies were conducted on flocculent estuarine sediment particles ranging from 2 to 50μm in diameter. The model was calibrated using time series particle size distributions extracted from samples taken from the column at different depths and times.},

	abstract = {The Center for Water Resource Studies and the Bowling Green Community College of Western Kentucky University has formed a partnership to address a Water \& Wastewater Operator/Technician shortage anticipated over the next few years as "Baby Boomers" retire. The Water and Wastewater Technician Training Institute (WTTI, pronounced "witty"), is a partnership with the employment sector (a growing number of water \& wastewater utilities/municipalities/districts), state primacy agencies and technical assistance/trade associations to refine an industry needs driven curriculum that utilizes on-line course delivery to provide options for both traditional \& non-traditional students. The partnership is revitalizing an existing Associates Degree program entitled “Water Utilities Management" and integrating 4-year transitions through formal articulation agreements. WTTI takes a pedagogical approach to elevating and transforming the water and wastewater operator positions from trades of last resort, to professions of choice, and the integrates practitioners into the recruitment, retention and educational process to achieve a coupled education, training and capacity development environment. A gradual and strategic elevation of the perception, both internal and external, of the trades, through a combination of increased capacity, mobility and accountability will attract high school students whose interests and scholarly record fall between the traditional trades/vocations and academically-based professions, and through inappropriate choices limit their career advancement potential, and elevate skill levels in the critical environmental and public health functions of the water and wastewater utility sector. In order to limit the hurdles associated with integrating regulatory, trade association and academic principles into a single, functional, coherent framework, WTTI is initially focused on Kentucky and Tennessee. However, as a demonstrably functional framework is put in place, extrapolating to address other regional policy, academic discipline and industrial sector issues becomes a logistical rather than conceptual challenge. Partnering utilities and municipalities are developing internship and co-operative educational opportunities to ensure work-based experiences for students in the program, while the trade associations have committed to developing scholarship programs to lessen the financial disincentive for potential students. Academic content is provided by core university faculty, while practitioner oriented content will be provided by qualified trade association and utility/municipality staff eligible for adjunct faculty status. Committed to the precept of open-knowledge, WTTI is extending and coupling an open-source hybrid practitioner cyber-collaboratory (based on Drupal) with an open-source course management system (Moodle) to integrate the learning environment with practitioners and enhance retention of both students and the retiring practitioner knowledge-base. All instructors (academic and practitioner) involved in the program will undergo collaborative professional development to ensure that they are receptive to the unique structure of the program. All aspects of the program will be available through this on-line environment, allowing current practitioners to participate both as mentors, and as students pursuing career advancement goals. Experiential components of the program include on-line virtual activities, as well as opportunities provided by partnering utilities and municipalities local to the student.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess feasibility and utility of different uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques in multimedia environmental applications. Sensitivity analysis techniques considered here include Plackett-Burman technique, response-surface methodology, and first order analysis. Uncertainty techniques include Monte-carlo analysis and point estimate method. These techniques were used to propagate uncertainty in these models assuming ±10\% (local scale) and ±50\% (global scale) uncertainty and variability in the inputs. The analysis was carried out for chlorobenzene and Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate (LAS) two chemicals exhibiting volatile and non-volatile tendencies respectively. The results indicate that for the conditions employed in this study, all the sensitivity techniques highlighted similar sensitive parameters. Plackett-Burman method is found to be fairly simple tool to identify key inputs, however, it does not account for interaction effects. Fractional factorial method provides this information but it is more complex and time-consuming. Interaction effects can be captured using response-surface method, which is comparatively less complex and hence it may be more preferable in risk-based decision-making. Point estimate method and Monte-Carlo analysis quantify the uncertainty in outputs and give almost similar results. Uncertainty in interactions of inputs is high on global scale for both chemicals, as demonstrated by Monte-Carlo analysis. Monte-Carlo analysis can be applied in combination with first order method to quantify uncertainty in outputs. This information could be useful in risk-based decision-making as the variations in the parameter interactions are significant.},

	abstract = {The study region of Lower Rio Grande extends from Laredo to Brownsville including the Laguna Madre/Port Mansfield coastal zone. The water quality in this region has been deteriorating steadily, and there are competing needs for the surface water in the basin. The primary aim of this project was to determine the feasibility of BASINS and WinHSPF (Windows interface of HSPF) model to assess the water quality of the Lower Rio Grande. WinHSPF is a planning level watershed model that integrates both point and non-point sources. The model was developed for the part of the river segment ’Rio Grande below Amistad Reservoir (2304)’ for the years 1993-1994. Existing data was used to calibrate the surface flow. The first step towards determining feasibility of the model i.e. calibration of the surface flow or water balance, was successfully completed. The project demonstrated that by with some limitations, BASINS and WinHSPF could be applied to the region. It also showed the necessity of more adequate data from U.S. and Mexican side of the river for more accurate results.},

	abstract = {The potential use of nutrients to stimulate in-situ hydrocarbon degradation in intertidal wetland environments was investigated. Previous studies have indicated that biodegradation of hydrocarbons can be stimulated with the addition of nutrients. Ammonium phosphate’s capacity to enhance biodegradation and its potential in the field was studied. Microcosm studies were conducted, and weathered Arabian light crude oil was the hydrocarbon used in the experiments. After 105 days of study, soils with added ammonium phosphate showed a greater degradation than the control soils with no added nutrients. Residual oil showed depletion of n-C17 and n-C18 (relative to hopane) in the nutrient series to be 1.3 times greater than that of the control series. Determination of first order depletion constants, k, showed treatment rate constants significantly larger than the rate constants for the control series.},

	abstract = {Use of sewage sludge on land is effective for improving soil structure and enhancing vegetation. The addition of sewage sludge provides organic matter and nutrients for growth of Bermudagrass. The study was performed to identify optimal sewage sludge application rates. A series of 6 experiments was designed to evaluate three rates of wet sewage sludge application. The experimental period was 5 months. Soil pH values decreased significantly in sludge amended columns. The highest rate of sludge application decreased to a pH of 7.3, whereas unamended columns had a pH of 8.8. Bermudagrass proliferated in sludge amended columns. Vegetation growth was greater in the highest rate of sludge application, but the lowest rate produced more root biomass. The lowest rate of sludge amended columns also maintained a low hydraulic conductivity (below 0.10 m/s) throughout the experimental period. The amended columns with no grass had a hydraulic conductivity as low as 0.03 m/s. The experiment provides a basis for future field-scale application of sewage sludge.},

	abstract = {A two-dimensional, depth averaged, finite element hydrodynamic numerical model was designed and applied for simulation of the hydrodynamics of the tidal portion of the LRGR (Lower Rio Grande River), Texas using Research Management Associates (RMA-2) software. A part of the Gulf of Mexico was also included in the mesh because tidal water affects the flow of the river, especially near the mouth. Boundary conditions were designated both by inflow (constant at upstream boundary in the study domain) and by the water surface elevation (dynamic head) at a radial distance of one mile from the mouth. The model output at each time step specified is comprised of water surface elevation and horizontal velocity. The animation of the water velocity showing the water flow inside the mesh and the flow trace were created through the post-processing attribute of SMS. RMA-2 could be used effectively to model the hydrodynamics of the tidal portion. However due to the unavailability of additional data set, the simulated values could not be verified with data from a different source.},

These rapidly multiplying colonias, from a Spanish term for neighborhoods, are settlements of varying size located along the border. Along the American side of the Texas-Mexico border alone, there are approximately 1800 colonias--the largest number of any border state--most of which lack basic water and sewer systems, paved roads, and safe and sanitary housing. Promotoras, from a Spanish term for lay community educators, are community leaders who live in the colonias and build important bridges between residents and the federal and state bureaucracies. These women have been trained to introduce their neighbors to state "systems" of government, education, and medical and social services that otherwise may lie out of reach. Promotoras are able to "translate" this training into culturally meaningful instruction that empowers community self-development. When neighbors teach neighbors, the message is received with greater trust and readiness to act.},

Despite the availability of high-capacity connections, scientists struggle with inadequate cyberinfrastructure that cripples data transfer performance, and impedes scientific progress. The Science DMZ paradigm comprises a proven set of network design patterns that collectively address these problems for scientists. We explain the Science DMZ model, including network architecture, system configuration, cybersecurity, and performance tools, that creates an optimized network environment for science. We describe use cases from universities, supercomputing centers and research laboratories, highlighting the effectiveness of the Science DMZ model in diverse operational settings. In all, the Science DMZ model is a solid platform that supports any science workflow, and flexibly accommodates emerging network technologies. As a result, the Science DMZ vastly improves collaboration, accelerating scientific discovery.},

Empathizing with historical characters and events can mediate understanding nature of physics for students. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of history of science on students' empathy with the historical characters and the events. With regards of socio-cultural theory, empathy was defined as a cultural tool, which mediates between students and the science society. The study was conducted in a private high school with participation of twenty-one 9th grade students in physics class for the unit of The Nature of Physics. A qualitative case-study method was employed. Data resources were video and audio recordings, field notes, students' tasks, interviews, and surveys. After transcribing and categorizing, the data were analyzed and patterns were organized. The findings supported eight aspects of empathy: Making Personal Connections, Imagination, Identification, Humanization, Understanding the Events, Understanding Different Perspectives, Understanding the Tentativeness of the Conclusions and Taking Perspectives. The results supported that students could interact with the culture of science with the use of the aspects of historical empathy. The use of the aspects of empathy attracted students' interest in physics lesson. The results are also promising for students' understanding nature of science.},

	abstract = {"Natural disasters in recent years have brought the study of disaster resiliency to the forefront. The importance of community preparedness and sustainability has been underscored by such calamities as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the Japanese tsunami in 2011. Natural disasters will inevitably continue to occur, but by understanding the concept of resiliency as well as the factors that lead to it, communities can minimize their vulnerabilities and increase their resilience.? In this volume, editors Naim Kapucu, Christopher V. Hawkins, and Fernando I. Rivera gather an impressive array of scholars to provide a much needed re-think to the topic disaster resiliency. Previous research on the subject has mainly focused on case studies, but this book offers a more systematic and empirical assessment of resiliency, while at the same time delving into new areas of exploration, including vulnerabilities of mobile home parks, the importance of asset mapping, and the differences between rural and urban locations. Employing a variety of statistical techniques and applying these to disasters in the United States and worldwide, this book examines resiliency through comparative methods which examine public management and policy, community planning and development, and, on the individual level, the ways in which culture, socio-economic status, and social networks contribute to resiliency. The analyses drawn will lead to the development of strategies for community preparation, response, and recovery to natural disasters."--Publisher's website.},

The mesocosm was subjected to a semidiurnal tidal cycle for three months to allow for acclimation prior to testing. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are essential elements for plant growth. Their availability determines the amount of organic matter available to support food webs. For this reason nitrate, phosphorus and total kjeldahl nitrogen were measured in the gravity outflow water, reservoir water and the soil. Biomass, a quantitative measure of the amount of living material present, was monitored in the both the gravity outflow and reservoir water as well as in the plants in the mesocosm. Since microbe biomass in water is difficult to determine, microbial biomass was correlated to total extractable adenosinetriphosphate. The precision of the P-value increased with time for all parameters analyzed across the mesocosm.},

Column studies were also conducted on the soils, to simulate the actual field conditions. Three concentrations were considered for the arsenate species. An average concentration was considered for arsenite. Victoria which has more organic, ferrous and clay content had showed the greatest sorption followed by Orelia and Willacy. Sorption of arsenate was greater than arsenite in all types of soils. Increase in sorption of both arsenate and arsenite was observed with increase in initial applied concentration. Break through curves from the column studies, indicated a steady state condition. In Column depth profile studies showed that Orelia and Willacy behaved similarly where as, Victoria had a large drop in arsenic concentration across the profile.},

This research study was aimed at creating an extensive database for the Baffin-Alazan Bay aquatic system for water and sediment quality parameters and their correlation with brown tide persistence. Laguna Salada was observed to have the maximum visible effect of the bloom during the research study. High biomass levels (up to \$1.88{\textbackslash}times10{\textbackslash}sp7\$/ml) were recorded. The sediment phosphorus levels were observed to be much higher than sediment nitrate levels. The biomass levels were found to show a negative correlation with water nitrate levels (p \${\textless}\$ 0.05) in the area with maximum visible brown tide effect.

The model input data were obtained from the published on-line data available from various agency and research institutes. The model output consisted of water surface elevation and velocity magnitude. The animation of the water velocity showing the water flow inside the bay was created. The sensitivity analysis on the model showed the response to the various values of input parameters. The most drastic effect on the model was due to the wind stress.

To accomplish this objective, a bench scale filtration apparatus was designed and constructed. Samples collected during the research were analyzed for TSS, Fluorescence, and Particle Size Distribution. Parameters measured during this study were flow rate, pressure increase, and media performance. 80\% of CEO was removed and a final average TSS concentration of 40 mg/L was achieved using a combination of Mixed Media (coarse sand, anthracite and gamet), PM-100 ® (anthracite and clay), and activated carbon. Results demonstrated the efficiency of the filtration media in the removal of CEO and TSS. The correct combination of filtration media could reduce CEO and TSS from the wastewater at COSS to levels which meet TNRCC guidelines.},

	abstract = {A quasi steady state heat transfer computer model was developed to predict heat transfer in the walls of a residential building, on an hourly basis. This model was designed to model the heat transfer of a whole residential building by compiling it with an existing attic transient heat and mass transfer model. This thesis compares the predictions of the computer model with experimental data to determine the validity of the model. This computer model can also be used to estimate the total amount of heat reduction and energy savings in room cooling and heating loads when using radiant barriers. Ambient temperature, hour of the day, and month of the year were input and hourly thermal load calculations were performed using the heat balance approach. Other inputs such as insulation data, ambient temperature, inside room temperature, and air velocity were input to the model. The output of the model recorded the total heat flux on the roof and walls; it also estimated the total amount of heat reduction and energy savings in room heating and cooling produced by the use of radiant barriers. The model predictions were validated by comparing the prediction of the model with experimental values from a test house located at the Texas A\&M University, Kingsville campus. Model differed by 6\% when compared to the experimental data. This model was created to test the performance of radiant barriers more accurately; however, due to lack of time, test on radiant barriers has not been completed. Thus, the model could not be validated nor used for this purpose at the present time. In the future, the model will be used to test radiant barriers.

The development of a web based flow routing model is a fundamental step in that direction. Java programming, U.S. EPA Reach File 1 (RF1) GIS dataset for the Conterminous United States, Internet GIS applications (ArcIMS) and water quality data (TNRCC) have been used in development efforts. In the course of the work done here several issues came to light such as the need for Java Servlets, ArcIMS and model interaction and the need for SQL databases. The results have been presented in the form of the current architectural framework and a predicted setup based. It was finally concluded that there is significant potential for web based modeling in order to do away with the limitations of traditional modeling approaches.},

Simple network represented the dredged channels and the complex networks included the wider and shallow sections. Model sensitivity analysis indicated that the river stretch, due to its depth, lack of vegetation, and sediment-removal, did not offer significant resistance to flow. Wind velocity and direction affected the flow pattern significantly. Tidal influence was considerable and the wider and shallow portions had very little movement. The complex network exhibited some deviations in flow, at certain segments due to the inadequacies of applying a 1-D model to a 2-D system.},

	abstract = {Due to recently enhanced understanding of particle aggregation in aquatic environments, we now have four possible approaches to modeling coagulation: the traditional Euclidean rectilinear, the Euclidean curvilinear, the fractal rectilinear, and the fractal curvilinear approaches. The primary purpose of this research is to investigate which model among these best predicts observations of particle size distribution (PSD) and its evolution. In order to do this, two fractal coagulation kinetic models (rectilinear and curvilinear) were developed. The models are generalized models, meaning the Euclidean models are a subset of the fractal models, and have one spatial dimension incorporating sedimentation and vertical dispersion as well as coagulation. The second phase of this work was a comparison of the four models based on a series of observed PSD data from a 2-m settling column using estuarine sediment particles. Nonlinear parameter estimation was performed to estimate two free parameters for the fractal models (the fractal dimension, \$D{\textbackslash}sbF,\$ and the collision efficiency factor, \${\textbackslash}alpha),\$ and one free parameter, \${\textbackslash}alpha,\$ for the Euclidean models. Compared with the observed PSD, the simulation showed that the fractal rectilinear model was best among the competing models, and that this model fit better for the larger size particles. The estimated \$D{\textbackslash}sbF\$ was between 2.6 and 3.0. The Euclidean curvilinear model underestimated the collision rates even with an α of 1.0, and the resultant fitting was worse than the Euclidean rectilinear case, contrary to the general belief. The research demonstrated that the α’s were calculated to have multiple values, depending on the coagulation models assumed. This finding appears to be significant because α is currently used as a single value based on the conventional Euclidean rectilinear model.},

The fundamental homogeneous diffusion model for describing membrane systems was the main framework for supporting the hypothesis investigated during this pilot study.

The behavior of the inorganic species studied, however, such as the total dissolved solids was consistent with the solvent and solute flux predicted by the fundamental diffusion model equations. It appears that organic solute passage and/or rejection involved three possible mechanisms: convection, sieving, and diffusion.},

Each of these hydrologic phenomena was represented by a specific equation. The values of the variable parameters in the equations were determined by sensitivity analysis. After selecting the values of the parameters a quadratic equation was derived. This equation represents the relationship between the depth of water in the channels and the change in the volume of water storage per unit time in the Santa Gertrudis Creek wetlands for the period of February-April. Using the data obtained from the field and the laboratory, the model was run for a year. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a nutrient cycling model of the wetlands.},

	abstract = {In-stream water quality is an important component of watershed management as it defines the intended use. Participatory watershed management involving multiple stakeholders is gaining acceptance for developing waste load allocations (WLA). WLAs specify the maximum pollutant loadings from permitted compliance systems and are a function of both science and policy. A goal-programming based simulation-optimization approach was developed to assess regional-scale assimilative capacity of a stream. This approach accounts for the heterogeneous nature of the water body regarding flow and non-point source loadings and identifies those sub-regions that are critically stressed. The model was used to develop an optimal loading scheme for the Arroyo Colorado river watershed. A Monte-Carlo reliability analysis was carried out to assess the risks associated with choosing the optimal loading scheme under parametric uncertainty. Ten different models were developed to assess the reliability of the optimal loading scheme under structural uncertainty. The results indicated that San Benito consistently had the highest probability of exceeding the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) standard; similarly, McAllen had the highest probability of failing to meet the dissolved oxygen (DO) standard in the Arroyo Colorado river watershed. The uncertainties arising from non-point source (NPS) estimation schemes were also evaluated and the Modified Rational method provided conservative estimates. Other decision support tools for evaluating various policy options were also developed. A framework for ranking model conceptualizations under stakeholder defined criteria was developed using fuzzy TOPSIS technique. The results indicated that inclusion of sediment oxygen demand was important for conservatism. Similarly, the impacts of future urbanization were also evaluated by developing plausible land use land cover projections in GIS. Characterizing urbanization was critical for establishing optimal BOD loadings regardless of the chosen conceptual model. An integrated probabilistic–fuzzy preference maximization model was developed and illustrated to simultaneously reconcile statistical randomness in biokinetic parameters and vague stakeholder preferences. This model provided equitable loading for each permitted compliance system. The developed decision support system tools are useful for fostering scientifically–credible, risk-informed and consensus-oriented waste load allocation schemes.},

Flourometry and HPLC were used to quantitate WAF concentrations of PAHs and BTEX respectively. The mechanically dispersed WAFs spiked exposure test resulted in a median lethal crude oil loading (LL50) = 3914 mg/L compared to a LL50 = 2766 mg/L for the continuous exposure assay. This data suggest that spiked exposures require higher WAF concentrations to achieve toxic responses similar to those due to continuous exposures. PAH data showed some correlation to aquatic toxicity data, while BTEX data showed no correlation. Microtox\${\textbackslash}sp{\textbackslash}circler\$ and fluorescence data revealed that chemically dispersed WAF EC50s were 2 to 29 greater than the mechanically dispersed WAF EC50s.

The two sites are the McAuliffe RDF and the Morris RDF; each site was incorporated with a constructed wetland with a different design and structure to enhance the pollutant removal process. The McAuliffe RDF reduced the concentration and load of many stormwater constituents in comparison to the Morris RDF. The observed concentrations and pollutant loads of suspended solids were much lower in the runoff of the inlet compared to the outlet for both sites. The McAuliffe RDF showed better concentration and load reduction for nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, of different species. However, both sites did not show a significant improvement of organic material. In addition, the indicator bacteria concentration represented a fluctuation between the inlet and outlet at each site.},

	abstract = {To address regional flooding in the United States, federal and state agencies are adopting strict drainage policies in any large-scale commercial development within the watershed boundary. The conventional approach of implementing a wet detention pond (WP) reduces the land cover and causes operation and maintenance challenges eventually. The present study developed a decision-support system (DSS) in the Lower Rio Grande Valley region of South Texas for optimal selection of Best Management Practices (BMPs) by substituting a portion of the WP footprint with three regionally promising low-impact development practices, namely, porous concrete pavement (PCP), bioretention (BR), and bioswale (BS). Source Load Assessment and Management Model for Windows (WinSLAMM) was used as the foundation for the DSS database and algorithm development. This tool suggested that the implementation of bioswale alone can considerably reduce the footprint and construction cost. Less than 0.95 ha of installation of BR and BS can mitigate 79\&ndash;91\% of runoff from a maximum of 5 ha of commercial development. A combination of BR, BS, and WP was found to reduce runoff significantly ( 100\%), which suggests that the successful adoption of DSS might support better planning of the urban stormwater management in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV).},

	abstract = {Lower Laguna Madre (LLM) is designated as an impaired watershed for high concentrations of bacteria and low dissolved oxygen. The main freshwater sources to the LLM flow from the North and Central waterways which are composed of three main waterways: Hidalgo/Willacy Main Drain (HWMD), Raymondville Drain (RVD) and International Boundary \& Water Commission North Floodway (IBWCNF) that are not fully characterized. The objective of this study is to perform a watershed characterization to determine the potential pollution sources of each watershed. The watershed characterization was achieved by developing a cyberinfrastructure and collects a wide inventory of data to identify which one of the three waterways has a major contribution to the LLM. Cyberinfrastructure development using the Geographic Information System (GIS) database helped to comprehend the major characteristics of each area contributing to the watershed supported by the analysis of the data collected. The watershed characterization process started with delineating the boundaries of each watershed. Then, geospatial and non-geospatial data were added to the cyberinfrastructure from numerous sources including point and non-point sources of pollution. Results showed that HWMD and IBWCNF watersheds were found to have a higher contribution to the water impairments to the LLM. HWMD and IBWCNF comprise the potential major sources of water quality impairments such as cultivated crops, urbanized areas, on-site sewage facilities, coloinas, and wastewater effluents.},

	abstract = {The overall purpose of this study was to characterize aggregates in terms of fractal dimension, and assess how this fractal dimension, as well as shear rate and Fe(III) coagulant dose, affect flocculation kinetics. The combination of an electronic particle counter and microscopic imaging techniques provided an accurate means of characterizing experimental flocculation particle size distribution kinetics, as well as aggregate fractal structure. Available particle contact area was assessed on a theoretical basis for numerical models ranging from a coalesced spherical through a full fractal floc assumption. Surface contact area increased by several orders of magnitude as a function of aggregate model complexity. This resulted in a corresponding increase in the number of collisions between particles. A controlled fluid shear dominated hydrodynamic environment was created in which flocculation of algal cells was measured by the fractal dimension of flocs as a function of Fe(III) coagulant concentration dose. The resultant surface charge was measured as electrophoretic mobility (EPM). EPM increased from -1.95 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.33 to 0.70 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.51 μm/s/V/cm as coagulant dose increased from 0 to 1.44 mg Fe\${\textbackslash}sp3+\$/L. The EPM related to particle concentration, or dilution, as a function of coagulant dose on a log-log basis. EPM, fractal dimension, and fractal aggregate particle density all directly related to shear rate, thus supporting a fractal floc assumption. Resulting fractal dimension values were 2.23 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.13 for the lowest velocity gradient of 2 s\${\textbackslash}sp-1\$ and 2.39 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.24 for the highest velocity gradient of 50 s\${\textbackslash}sp-1\$. Therefore shear rate and electrophoretic mobility can be used as flocculation potential and floc fractal dimension indicators. Collision efficiency was determined by a generic parameter estimation algorithm using the monodispersed, polydispersed, and coalesced fractal sphere floc collision frequency functions in a completely mixed flocculation numerical model simulating the batch experimental system. Model results demonstrated the inadequacy of non-fractal formulations to characterize flocculation of low particle concentration (9-15,000/mL) systems under moderate fluid shear (2-50 s\${\textbackslash}sp-1\$) conditions. Overall, the flocculation kernel that incorporated fractal floc geometry substantially improved model agreement with observed data over the Euclidean monodispersed and polydispersed assumptions.},

	abstract = {Although the development of modern shrimp culture technology from traditional extensive to semi-intensive and intensive is by all means economically successful, it causes adverse effects on the environment. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) has imposed effluent quality discharge limitations on some of the shrimp farms operating in the South Texas area. Selected water quality parameters of shrimp farms in Rio-Grande valley were studied by research teams from Texas Agriculture Extension Station (TAES), Texas A \& M University-Corpus Christi and Texas A \& M University-Kingsville. Results suggests that total suspended solids and nutrients are the major potential pollutants. The values of daily average net increase in TSS level in the effluent of Taiwan Shrimp Village Farm (TSVF) was about four times higher than the intake concentration during the preharvesting and harvesting seasons. Results indicated lower TSS levels during the harvesting season compared to that of the preharvesting season. Increase in levels of nitrite, nitrate, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorous, and reactive phosphorous, in the effluent than their respective concentrations in the intake of the farms during the preharvesting and harvesting periods were also observed. Average concentration of chlorophyll (a) is slightly higher immediately below the farms main discharge in the Arroyo Colorado compared to the intake. During the intensive monitoring period in the harvesting season the effluent coming out of pond ⋕24 ranged between 41 to 945 mg/L, but by the time the effluent reached the individual discharge station TV2 the levels have dropped to 62 mg/L. This indicates that the drainage canal might have acted as some kind of settling pond to remove the suspended solids.},

The concentration of Fumonisin was determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and the retention time of Fumonisin was found to be 2.6 min and that the Fumonisin is metabolized into two other compounds. The identification of these compounds is beyond the scope of the present study, and will be determined in future studies. Maximum growth and degradation was observed with microbial isolate 5 at 2 μl volume. In all cases, microbial growth and degradation of Fumonisin seemed to be correlated.

	abstract = {Disaster impact assessments are crucial for understanding disasters and effective disaster prevention. Deciding how to respond to disasters cannot be efficient without considering the disaster’s social and economic impacts. Among all types of disasters, drought and flood induce the largest human and economic cost. Interbasin transfer is a commonly used strategy to overcome the mismatch between water availability and water demand, and enhance economic development. The researches present within this dissertation discuss how can we develop an efficient economic impact model or models which can take into consideration sector vulnerability and resiliency strategies in response to extreme climate events, to assist decision makers in devising response strategies. The first and second studies in this dissertation investigate methods to assess the economic consequences of drought induced water restriction and the economic consequences of flood impact in public water supply systems. Drought and flood induce water outage, and cause substantial impacts in public water supply systems. However, researches and tools which assess drought and flood impact in water supply systems are uncommon. We adapt previous work on economic consequence assessment in the event of water services disruption to evaluate the economic impact of water restrictions resulting from extended drought conditions, and water contamination and outage resulting from flood conditions. These two models focus on all commercial and industrial economic sectors across multiple basins using a continuous dynamic social accounting matrix approach.The third study in this dissertation investigates the interbasin transfer impact to the basin(s), with a focus on agriculture production, and discusses the necessity to establish a state-level interbasin transfer regulation in Alabama. A framework for comprehensive impact assessment of interbasin transfer is developed in this dissertation. The interbasin transfer research reviews four representative interbasin transfer projects, concludes the triggers of interbasin transfer projects and impacts in economic, hydrologic, ecological, and social systems. The relation between irrigation and agriculture production is simulated with AquaCrop. Three states’ interbasin transfer regulations and acts are studied. Results indicate the required processes to establish a state-level interbasin transfer regulation and the focuses of future researches.},

The soil was analyzed for texture, swell shrinkage, bulk density and moisture. The effluent was analyzed for COD, BOD 5 , pH, Total Phosphorous, Kjeldahl Nitrogen, Nitrite, Nitrate and Fecal Coliforms. Effluent flow rates were estimated from the number of occupants or bedrooms. The hydraulic conductivity of the soil at different locations in the drip field were determined through permeability tests. A multi-regression analysis was carried out to get the relationship between failure of system, loading rate, and other parameters such as soil type, clay content, and swell shrinkage. Removal efficiencies of the drip system were: BOD 5 (56-68\%), COD (41-53\%), Fecal coliforms 49.5\%, Total Phosphorous 80.5\%, Nitrite 90.3\%, Total Suspended Solids 95\%.},

	abstract = {The Center for Water Resource Studies and the Bowling Green Community College of Western Kentucky University has formed a partnership to address a Water \& Wastewater Operator/Technician shortage anticipated over the next few years as \&quot;Baby Boomers\&quot; retire. The Water and Wastewater Technician Training Institute (WTTI, pronounced \&quot;witty\&quot;), is a partnership with the employment sector (a growing number of water \& wastewater utilities/municipalities/districts), state primacy agencies and technical assistance/trade associations to refine an industry needs driven curriculum that utilizes on-line course delivery to provide options for both traditional \& non-traditional students. The partnership is revitalizing an existing Associates Degree program entitled \&ldquo;Water Utilities Management\&quot; and integrating 4-year transitions through formal articulation agreements. WTTI takes a pedagogical approach to elevating and transforming the water and wastewater operator positions from trades of last resort, to professions of choice, and the integrates practitioners into the recruitment, retention and educational process to achieve a coupled education, training and capacity development environment. A gradual and strategic elevation of the perception, both internal and external, of the trades, through a combination of increased capacity, mobility and accountability will attract high school students whose interests and scholarly record fall between the traditional trades/vocations and academically-based professions, and through inappropriate choices limit their career advancement potential, and elevate skill levels in the critical environmental and public health functions of the water and wastewater utility sector. In order to limit the hurdles associated with integrating regulatory, trade association and academic principles into a single, functional, coherent framework, WTTI is initially focused on Kentucky and Tennessee. However, as a demonstrably functional framework is put in place, extrapolating to address other regional policy, academic discipline and industrial sector issues becomes a logistical rather than conceptual challenge. Partnering utilities and municipalities are developing internship and co-operative educational opportunities to ensure work-based experiences for students in the program, while the trade associations have committed to developing scholarship programs to lessen the financial disincentive for potential students. Academic content is provided by core university faculty, while practitioner oriented content will be provided by qualified trade association and utility/municipality staff eligible for adjunct faculty status. Committed to the precept of open-knowledge, WTTI is extending and coupling an open-source hybrid practitioner cyber-collaboratory (based on Drupal) with an open-source course management system (Moodle) to integrate the learning environment with practitioners and enhance retention of both students and the retiring practitioner knowledge-base. All instructors (academic and practitioner) involved in the program will undergo collaborative professional development to ensure that they are receptive to the unique structure of the program. All aspects of the program will be available through this on-line environment, allowing current practitioners to participate both as mentors, and as students pursuing career advancement goals. Experiential components of the program include on-line virtual activities, as well as opportunities provided by partnering utilities and municipalities local to the student.},

	abstract = {Modeling the transport and fate of spilled crude oil is important for estimating short and long-term toxicity effects in coastal ecosystems. This research project investigates the partitioning of hydrocarbons from a surface crude oil slick, the resurfacing of chemically dispersed crude oil droplets, the suitability of in-situ field instruments for oil and sediment characterization, and the aggregation and settling of dispersed oil and suspended sediments. An initial laboratory study was conducted to investigate apparent hydrocarbon solubility in petroleum/water systems. Mixing shear and initial crude oil layer thickness were related empirically to oil entrainment rate. A model describing hydrocarbons partitioned in colloidal and soluble phases was consistent with experimental data. A second laboratory study was conducted to investigate the influence of coalescence kinetics on mean droplet size and resurfacing rate of chemically dispersed crude oil droplets. Increased mean shear rates resulted in mean droplet diameters and oil resurfacing rates. A third laboratory study was conducted to compare particle size and fractal dimension measurements obtained using a submersible flow cytometer, an electrozone particle counter, and a light scattering particle sizer. Measured particles included latex beads, crude oil, clay, crude oil-clay aggregates, and crude oil-silica aggregates. Tested instruments gave consistent size measurements for all particle systems, suggesting their suitability for sizing marine particles. To describe the aggregation kinetics of oil-sediment systems, a modified Smoluchowski model based on coalesced sphere (CS) assumptions was developed. Observed collision efficiency values (α OBS ) were related to collision efficiency values for single particle type systems (α HOMO ) and those for two particle type systems (α HET ) using a probabilistic approach. For clay and crude oil, α HOMO values were higher than the α HOMO value for silica. Clay-oil and silica-oil have similar α HET values. Thus, crude oil can significantly increase the aggregation rates of noncohesive sediments such as silica. The CS model above was modified to incorporate sediment fractal geometry. The ability of this modified coalesced fractal sphere (mCFS) model to fit experimental data sets was better than that of a coalesced sphere (CS) model. Because of their reduced settling rates, sediments with lower fractal dimension form more aggregate with dispersed oil.},

The data show that in the presence of semi-diurnal tide for sand with high porosity the water table in the artificial beach declines gradually with distance from the surf zone. In addition, the water table at a fixed point inside the beach is not sinusoidal although the forcing tide is essentially sinusoidal. This effect is due to the non-linear nature of the problem, which is compensated for, by using relative tidal amplitude and perturbation parameter. The first degree of this correction fits the field data better than Boussinesq’s equation. Similarly, second degree perturbation parameter fits the field data even better for the landward sensors. However, the prediction of model is not exact as the field data because the boundary conditions of model are not appropriate for mesocosm application.},

The analysis of data collected shows that an average of 747 cubic yards/month of the waste were generated against the available dumpster volume capacity of 1756 cubic yards/month. This accounts for only 43\% of the available volume utilization. Of the collected waste, 536 cubic yards/month are recyclable, which is 73\% of the total volume of waste generated. Based on the percentage utilization of total dumpster volumes, it is possible to reduce dumpster volumes by 546 cubic yards/month by decreasing 15 dumpsters and another 84 cubic yards/month by improving the waste collection system, which accounts for 36\% of the total dumpster volumes. Cost analysis shows that after compensating for the cost of the new recycle program, a 20\% reduction in overall waste disposal cost can be achieved. Total elimination of paper towel waste can be achieved by providing hand dryers at all restrooms, which accounts for 10\% of total waste stream. A mathematical model has been developed to predict the quantity of different waste categories generated based on the student and staff population, and number of buildings that are involved in the program. Specific recommendations concerning a midsize university recycling program optimization are provided.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model was developed to predict total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) degradation in an oilspill impacted inter-tidal wetland system. The whole system was divided into four individual components/compartments, i.e., plant biomass (macrophyte), water column, sediment and rest of the external environment. Thirteen state variables including macrophyte biomass, macrophyte internal nutrients (N\${\textbackslash}sb2\$ \& P), water column and sediment nutrients (N\${\textbackslash}sb2\$, P, TPH \& O\${\textbackslash}sb2\$), water column and sediment microorganisms were considered most significant in affecting the performance of the system regarding degradation. Considering different interactions between all 13 state variables as well as some external forcing functions like light, temperature, re-aeration, decay (of microorganisms) etc., different processes were formulated using algebraic expressions. Individual model equations were written to define the time rate changes of each state variable considering all the interactions affecting the variable. A mass balance among the processes was also performed. Field data for most of the state variables were collected from a microcosm study conducted at Texas A\&M University-Kingsville for a period of 105 days. With these data the model was calibrated. The curves showing observed vs. predicted data (except for water column phosphorous) indicated very good prediction and correlation between model results and experimental observations. Taking the calibrated values of the coefficients the model was run for a period of five years. The variation of different state variables over this 5-year period was observed to verify the model. To conduct a sensitivity analysis, five coefficients were selected. Time variations of the state variables due to the change in the coefficient values over a specific range were observed. Arrhenius attenuation factor and maximum specific growth rate of microorganisms in water were observed to be the most sensitive parameter of this model.},

An argument can be made that the basic precepts espoused by the Free Software Foundation should be translatable to all branches of engineering, and in particular to projects directly benefiting the public. The concepts of open source and commercial viability are not mutually exclusive, as evidenced by the so called Red Hat Business Model that has seen much press of late. Of key value in the open source business model is the emphasis on the valuation of effort rather than the restriction of knowledge as the basis of market competitiveness. Further advantages include the more rapid leveraging of new knowledge into better products and services, and an overall lowering of the total cost of ownership or commensurate cost of services to the end user. This paper will provide an in-depth review of the business models employed by Civil/Environmental engineers in both the public and the private sector against a backdrop of public works projects. Included will be an assessment of the increasing role that intellectual property protection plays in market competitiveness of engineering service providers, the effect of proprietary technologies have in shaping the demographics of providers, the role that engineering education has in defining this evolution, and the impact this may have on public infrastructure.},

	url = {http://ir.ua.edu/handle/123456789/2577},
	abstract = {Research on short lead-time flood inundation and damage assessment traditionally focuses on developing tools for long term planning. Studies that investigate the ability to provide short lead-time analyses are uncommon because of sparcity and spatial inconsistency of short-term hydrologic forecasts. Recent advances in continental scale hydrology make possible the ability to predict discharge at nearly all locations in the conterminous United States (CONUS). Theoretically, these discharge outputs enable investigation into the plausibility of short lead-time hydraulic, and damage analyses during flood events. A system predicting the hydraulics and damage potential of floods is only feasible after addressing a number of limitations. For instance, hydraulic models require a characterization of the stream channel, either through site surveys or through approximations. Further, the damage estimation methodology requires building inventories, which are developable by similar mechanisms. This dissertation advances knowledge on how to possibly address these limitations. The first study in this dissertation investigates the use of hydraulic geometries. Hydraulic geometries relate river channel geometry to bankfull discharge. However, the research presented here indicates that hydraulic geometries may estimate both the channel geometry and multiple depths of flow, under certain geomorphic and anthropogenic constraints. Accurate channel geometries are necessary for hydraulic modeling. Depth of flow estimates are useful in developing stage-discharge rating curves and possibly as a standalone means of estimating inundation grids. The second and third studies in this research look to investigate a framework for rapid flood damage assessment using public domain cadastral or parcel geospatial data. The second study discusses a fuzzy logic framework for meshing emergency response Address Points with parcel data and appropriate depth-damage relationships to determine both percent and fiscal impact of flood damage. Results of the second study highlight the effectiveness of determining flood damage with cadastral data using fuzzy text matching. The third study investigates what inputs from the cadastral data are necessary for the fuzzy logic framework to approximate a detailed flood damage investigation. Results indicate that fuzzy logic can approximate a detailed study when provided discrete use descriptions, market value, and square footage.},

Identifying the appropriate approach necessitates integrating rules and requirements from these knowledge domains in such a way that the operational goals are achieved with minimally available situational information. Disaster forecasting, warning, recovery, and response must be able to adapt and evolve as new information becomes available. To date, there has been a limited amount of work developing expert systems in this area. In order to fill the knowledge gap, this study 1) identifies and assimilates the knowledge necessary for Water Distribution Network (WDN) decontamination, local flood forecasting and warning, and local flood response coordination and training; 2) determines the relative utility of architectures of expert systems and conventional codes; 3) evaluates the relative benefits of forward and backward chaining inferential logic in these scenarios. Based on the outcome of the conceptual systems, we develop three complete backward chaining expert systems, respectively. With extensible knowledge bases combined with the information provided by the users, the expert systems successfully provide reasoning routines, recommendations, and guidance on disaster forecasting, warning, recovery, and response in water resources management.},

For this purpose reverse osmosis membrane modules can be designed based on experimental data supported by computer models to determine energy efficient configurations and operating conditions. In previous studies numerical models have been suggested to predict the performance of the removal with respect to difference pressures, pH values, and temperatures. Here, an analytical model is suggested which allows for both the simplified fitting of the parameters required for predicting boron transport coefficients and also the simple equations that can be used for the design of combined seawater and boron removal systems. This modelling methodology is demonstrated through two case studies including FilmTec and Saehan membrane modules. For both cases the model is shown to be able to predict the performance with similar accuracy compared with existing finite-difference type numerical models from the literature.},

While casino companies mainly rely on websites to communicate CSR issues, 23\% of the sample companies use standalone CSR reports. Whereas websites tend to provide relatively limited information about CSR activities, standalone CSR reports have a tendency to cover comprehensive CSR themes in a detailed manner. In addition, the content analysis based on website reveals that while most casino companies tend to be passive about responsible gaming, some are trying to behave more actively and responsibly about this issue.},

A decision support system (DSS) that addresses all these issues is developed in this study by embedding mass-balance expressions, GIS, and a remote-sensing-based non-point source loading scheme into a hybrid goal-programming approach and is applied to the rapidly growing Arroyo Colorado River watershed along the US–Mexico border. The model components were favorably evaluated against field data and previous studies. The DSS was used to evaluate the carrying capacity of the river, defined based on the water quality standards for biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, and minimum in-stream flow requirements. The results indicated that on a macro-scale, the current stresses utilize about 40 \% of the maximum carrying capacity. However, the most upstream and downstream sub-watersheds are currently over stressed and need to reduce their loadings. The assimilative capacity of the river is not sufficient to carry current flows at their permitted discharge concentrations implying an inequity among discharges with regard to treatment cost burden. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the carrying capacity was more affected by policy choices made for water quality standards then where they were to be enforced (i.e., compliance locations). Urban areas currently cover 13 \% of the watershed but contribute nearly 45 \% of the total non-point source loadings. Therefore, the urbanization in this watershed must be carefully planned with emphasis on stormwater treatment and management to sustain this valuable resource for future generations.},
