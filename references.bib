	abstract = {The {EPA} requires in the Final Guidelines for the Certification and Recertification of the Operators of Community and Nontransient Noncommunity Public Water Systems Notice (1999) that states and {US} territories establish some sort of experiential or on-the-job training requirement for incumbent water or wastewater operators before they can legally become licensed professionals. In fact, some states require the operator to possess an adequate amount of experience in real-time plant operations, in order to take the certification exam. However, many times utilities discover that after the duration of training has passed, the would-be operator still does not hold the knowledge needed to pass the certification exam. This presents a well-defined problem when attempting to establish a succession plan for future employment needs, an issue currently plaguing the water industry. A resolution of this issue will involve a training program that seeks to model a mix of educational and experiential components which will produce professionals that have attained sufficient academic and operational expertise. This will require facilitators on each wavelength, academic and industrial, to cooperate in order to achieve the desired outcome. One such program that is currently pursuing such a venture is the Water Training Institute ({WTI}). Created by funds garnered from the Advanced Technological Education ({ATE}) division of the National Science Foundation ({NSF}), the {WTI} program has sought to address the developing workforce needs of the industry by providing pertinent academic training for aspiring operators, all while striving for partnerships with both industrial and regulatory agencies. The {WTI} Steering Committee, a group comprised of educational, industrial, and regulatory experts, epitomizes the necessary cooperation to develop a viable training program. A by-product of such cooperation is a grouping of individual utilities, known as {UNet}, which have agreed to provide the experiential cornerstone of the educational framework by providing internship avenues for student within the {WTI} program. This service ensures that graduates of {WTI} are provided the obligatory experience required for professional licensure. These utilities, in effect, become the instructors of this internship and are given the ability to grade the intern’s performance and to provide an adequate amount of real-life experience to the intern, so that successful simulation of day-to-day operation can occur. Present day evolution of the program has continued by adapting a curricula designed to meet the needs of those who cannot participate in traditional formats. This new format, a modular, self- paced system dissects the original format, breaking the original semester-based format into smaller sub-sections. This grants a greater flexibility to those students that are currently working within the water industry, providing another avenue for a simultaneous educational/experiential curriculum. Interestingly, these internships have harbored not only experience for interns but have in some instances transitioned into fulltime positions with the utilities that have provided the internship.This construct is a win-win scenario for both the utility and student, and would not be possible without sufficient cooperation between all three branches comprising {WTI}.},

The test protocols for batch experiments were arrived at based on the preliminary experiments and pilot batch experiments conducted and parameters to be tested for. Seal beach mix which was being cultured in {CFSTR} enriched with west Texas crude oil was used as innoculum. In the course of experiments were recorded by the computer. Simultaneously {TPH} removal and biomass growth were recorded. From these values percent biodegradation, cumulative oxygen uptake, rate of oxygen uptake values were computed. Based on the observation, analysis of test results and conclusions drawn disturbed Bunket C with liquid fertilizer mix combination gave maximum yield. Oxygen uptake and biomass growth were directly proportional to percentage biodegradation.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in water quality assessment is the development and implementation of the analysis tools. One has to perform a series of steps such as data mining, map generation and simulating and interpreting models. These isolated steps can lead to lack of integration and limited coordination. The objective of this research is to develop a multipurpose spatial decision support system where decision makers, stakeholders and public are provided with data, maps and assessment tools over the web. Temporal data is incorporated with Spatial System and are stored in a distributed database to test its adequacy over the web. Web based Geological Information System ({GIS}) was used to visualize and assess water quality over the web for an end user with minimum knowledge and computing experience. The Spatial Decision Support System was developed for this study focuses on the Lower Rio Grande river basin. Water quality data for the study region from various sources were obtained and stored in a relational database management system. The stored data was provided over the web using a graphical user interface with water quality assessment tools and tools to identify different management options. The availability of data and assessment tools over the web is expected to increase public participation in decision-making process and effectiveness of water quality assessment over the web.},

	abstract = {The toxicities of crude oil and crude oil plus dispersant Water Accommodated Fractions ({WAFs}) were evaluated in three toxicity testing systems: spiked and continuous exposures to Mysidopsis bahia were tested in flow-through and static testing systems respectively; microbial toxicity was tested with Microbics Microtox\${\textbackslash}sp{\textbackslash}circler\$. Flourometry and {HPLC} were used to quantitate {WAF} concentrations of {PAHs} and {BTEX} respectively. The mechanically dispersed {WAFs} spiked exposure test resulted in a median lethal crude oil loading ({LL}50) = 3914 mg/L compared to a {LL}50 = 2766 mg/L for the continuous exposure assay. This data suggest that spiked exposures require higher {WAF} concentrations to achieve toxic responses similar to those due to continuous exposures. {PAH} data showed some correlation to aquatic toxicity data, while {BTEX} data showed no correlation. Microtox\${\textbackslash}sp{\textbackslash}circler\$ and fluorescence data revealed that chemically dispersed {WAF} {EC}50s were 2 to 29 greater than the mechanically dispersed {WAF} {EC}50s. This suggests that the chemically dispersed {WAFs} have a lower percentage of toxic components per unit concentration that the mechanically dispersed {WAFs}. No significant toxicity variance was observed between the two aquatic test systems and the microbial assay.},

	volume = {10},
	rights = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {With fast population growth and economic development in the {US}-Mexico Borderland, water diversion and usages has reduced the flow substantially in the Low Rio Grande River ({LRGR}). Tidal portion of the {LRGR} has posed an environmental drought issue since 1993 and the channel clogged with the invasion of non-native plants also causes environmental problems. As a result of the intensity of these natural and manmade factors, the Rio Grande stopped flowing to the sea in February 2001. The flows were reduced to a point that they were unable to push out the sand deposited at the mouth. Geomorphologic evolution in association with the fluvial process of the {LRGR} has received wide attention. The purpose of this study is to investigate the necessary flow to maintain the river mouth open to the Gulf of Mexico using integrated approach of remote sensing and numerical analysis. It also sheds lights on possible solutions in decision-making. The analysis starts with a geomorphologic analysis using satellite remote sensing imagery and historic flow rate assessment, followed by a two-dimensional, depth averaged, finite element numerical modeling analysis to simulate the hydrodynamics of the tidal portion of the {LRGR}. While Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus ({ETM}+) satellite imagery and Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles ({DOQs}) were used for the geomorphologic investigation, Research Management Associates ({RMA}-2) software and Surface Water Modeling System ({SMS} 8.0) were used for minimum stream flow rate analysis. Alternative geomorphic conditions were modeled and compared to the original case, where two simulation runs were established. The first one was designed in dealing with a more refined mesh; and the second was prepared for handling an increased discharge at the inflow boundary along with the investigation of shear stress. The study concludes that the peak shear stress increased with increasing discharge towards the mouth of the river and a 1.27 m3/s discharge is necessary to maintain the opening of the river mouth.},

	abstract = {A flocculent particle transport model was developed to aid in the assessment of particle mediated transport of pollutants in aquatic environments. The model included flocculation driven by binary inter-particle collisions and aggregate breakup driven by particle erosion. A framework was developed in conjunction with the predictive model to synthesize experimental data into the unknown model parameters. The basis of the method lies in the minimization of the variation between model predictions and observations via the iterative numerical determination of the functional minima of a residual function with respect to the parameters being determined. Model parameters have been estimated successfully for analytical and numerical solutions to dispersive, advective-dispersive and flocculent particle transport model equations. The effect of sampling or measurement error and initial parameter estimates on algorithm performance has been evaluated. This approach has been successfully applied to determine data requirements and constraints (quantity, quality and location) for measurement of hydrodynamic and transport characteristics of dye clouds and cohesive aquatic particles in laboratory mixed settling columns. A sensitivity analysis on limited particle size category resolution indicates that particle water column residence times may be significantly overestimated using distributions of less than 8 categories. A computer automated mixed settling column, designed to characterize the vertical transport of suspended particulate material in turbulent aquatic environments, was constructed to verify and calibrate the flocculent transport model within the parameter estimation framework. Dye studies were conducted for hydrodynamic characterization of the column. Continuous transmissometer data taken at various depths in the column were used to extract dispersion coefficients from the dispersive transport model coupled to the parameter estimation framework. Non-flocculent silica particles between 0.5 and 40μm in diameter were used for advection dominant transport studies and column verification. Particle transport studies were conducted on flocculent estuarine sediment particles ranging from 2 to 50μm in diameter. The model was calibrated using time series particle size distributions extracted from samples taken from the column at different depths and times.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess feasibility and utility of different uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques in multimedia environmental applications. Sensitivity analysis techniques considered here include Plackett-Burman technique, response-surface methodology, and first order analysis. Uncertainty techniques include Monte-carlo analysis and point estimate method. These techniques were used to propagate uncertainty in these models assuming ±10\% (local scale) and ±50\% (global scale) uncertainty and variability in the inputs. The analysis was carried out for chlorobenzene and Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate ({LAS}) two chemicals exhibiting volatile and non-volatile tendencies respectively. The results indicate that for the conditions employed in this study, all the sensitivity techniques highlighted similar sensitive parameters. Plackett-Burman method is found to be fairly simple tool to identify key inputs, however, it does not account for interaction effects. Fractional factorial method provides this information but it is more complex and time-consuming. Interaction effects can be captured using response-surface method, which is comparatively less complex and hence it may be more preferable in risk-based decision-making. Point estimate method and Monte-Carlo analysis quantify the uncertainty in outputs and give almost similar results. Uncertainty in interactions of inputs is high on global scale for both chemicals, as demonstrated by Monte-Carlo analysis. Monte-Carlo analysis can be applied in combination with first order method to quantify uncertainty in outputs. This information could be useful in risk-based decision-making as the variations in the parameter interactions are significant.},

The water quality in this region has been deteriorating steadily, and there are competing needs for the surface water in the basin. The primary aim of this project was to determine the feasibility of {BASINS} and {WinHSPF} (Windows interface of {HSPF}) model to assess the water quality of the Lower Rio Grande. {WinHSPF} is a planning level watershed model that integrates both point and non-point sources. The model was developed for the part of the river segment ’Rio Grande below Amistad Reservoir (2304)’ for the years 1993-1994. Existing data was used to calibrate the surface flow. The first step towards determining feasibility of the model i.e. calibration of the surface flow or water balance, was successfully completed. The project demonstrated that by with some limitations, {BASINS} and {WinHSPF} could be applied to the region. It also showed the necessity of more adequate data from U.S. and Mexican side of the river for more accurate results.},

	abstract = {In response to the needs for long-term water quality monitoring, one of the most significant challenges currently facing the water industry is to investigate the sensor placement strategies with modern concepts of and approaches to risk management. Most of the previous research mainly focuses on using optimization models to deal with small-scale drinking water networks. Yet the challenge of {NP} complete when handling large-scale networks can never be overcome. This study develops a rule-based expert system ({RBES}) to generate sensor deployment strategies with no computational burden as we oftentimes encountered via various types of optimization analyses. Two rules, including the accessibility and complexity rules, were derived to address the characteristics of effectiveness and efficiency required for sensor deployment in these networks. To retrieve the information of population exposure, the well-calibrated {EPANET} model was applied for the vulnerability assessment leading to the derivation of the accessibility rule whereas the graph theory was employed to retrieve the complexity rule eliminating the need to deal with temporal variability. Comparisons between this new expert system and 14 existing optimization and heuristic models confirm that the newly developed expert system in this paper can always compete with most of the optimization models. With no computational burden, the {RBES} that is designed to promote health risk management could also be applicable to deal with similar applications in large-scale drinking water distribution networks.},

Microcosm studies were conducted, and weathered Arabian light crude oil was the hydrocarbon used in the experiments. After 105 days of study, soils with added ammonium phosphate showed a greater degradation than the control soils with no added nutrients. Residual oil showed depletion of n-C17 and n-C18 (relative to hopane) in the nutrient series to be 1.3 times greater than that of the control series. Determination of first order depletion constants, k, showed treatment rate constants significantly larger than the rate constants for the control series.},

A part of the Gulf of Mexico was also included in the mesh because tidal water affects the flow of the river, especially near the mouth. Boundary conditions were designated both by inflow (constant at upstream boundary in the study domain) and by the water surface elevation (dynamic head) at a radial distance of one mile from the mouth. The model output at each time step specified is comprised of water surface elevation and horizontal velocity. The animation of the water velocity showing the water flow inside the mesh and the flow trace were created through the post-processing attribute of {SMS}. {RMA}-2 could be used effectively to model the hydrodynamics of the tidal portion. However due to the unavailability of additional data set, the simulated values could not be verified with data from a different source.},

Soil {pH} values decreased significantly in sludge amended columns. The highest rate of sludge application decreased to a {pH} of 7.3, whereas unamended columns had a {pH} of 8.8. Bermudagrass proliferated in sludge amended columns. Vegetation growth was greater in the highest rate of sludge application, but the lowest rate produced more root biomass. The lowest rate of sludge amended columns also maintained a low hydraulic conductivity (below 0.10 m/s) throughout the experimental period. The amended columns with no grass had a hydraulic conductivity as low as 0.03 m/s. The experiment provides a basis for future field-scale application of sewage sludge.},

Stormwater management systems such as detention facilities and wetland can improve the water quality by removing various pollutants associated with the runoff. The objective of this research project is to determine the performance and efficiency of two major regional detention facilities ({RDFs}) with different designs and structures in reducing pollutants based on various storm events in {McAllen}, Texas. The two sites are the {McAuliffe} {RDF} and the Morris {RDF}; each site was incorporated with a constructed wetland with a different design and structure to enhance the pollutant removal process. The {McAuliffe} {RDF} reduced the concentration and load of many stormwater constituents in comparison to the Morris {RDF}. The observed concentrations and pollutant loads of suspended solids were much lower in the runoff of the inlet compared to the outlet for both sites. The {McAuliffe} {RDF} showed better concentration and load reduction for nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, of different species. However, both sites did not show a significant improvement of organic material. In addition, the indicator bacteria concentration represented a fluctuation between the inlet and outlet at each site.},

	abstract = {To address regional flooding in the United States, federal and state agencies are adopting strict drainage policies in any large-scale commercial development within the watershed boundary. The conventional approach of implementing a wet detention pond ({WP}) reduces the land cover and causes operation and maintenance challenges eventually. The present study developed a decision-support system ({DSS}) in the Lower Rio Grande Valley region of South Texas for optimal selection of Best Management Practices ({BMPs}) by substituting a portion of the {WP} footprint with three regionally promising low-impact development practices, namely, porous concrete pavement ({PCP}), bioretention ({BR}), and bioswale ({BS}). Source Load Assessment and Management Model for Windows ({WinSLAMM}) was used as the foundation for the {DSS} database and algorithm development. This tool suggested that the implementation of bioswale alone can considerably reduce the footprint and construction cost. Less than 0.95 ha of installation of {BR} and {BS} can mitigate 79\&ndash;91\% of runoff from a maximum of 5 ha of commercial development. A combination of {BR}, {BS}, and {WP} was found to reduce runoff significantly ( 100\%), which suggests that the successful adoption of {DSS} might support better planning of the urban stormwater management in the Lower Rio Grande Valley ({LRGV}).},

	abstract = {The Center for Water Resource Studies and the Bowling Green Community College of Western Kentucky University has formed a partnership to address a Water \& Wastewater Operator/Technician shortage anticipated over the next few years as "Baby Boomers" retire. The Water and Wastewater Technician Training Institute ({WTTI}, pronounced "witty"), is a partnership with the employment sector (a growing number of water \& wastewater utilities/municipalities/districts), state primacy agencies and technical assistance/trade associations to refine an industry needs driven curriculum that utilizes on-line course delivery to provide options for both traditional \& non-traditional students. The partnership is revitalizing an existing Associates Degree program entitled “Water Utilities Management" and integrating 4-year transitions through formal articulation agreements. {WTTI} takes a pedagogical approach to elevating and transforming the water and wastewater operator positions from trades of last resort, to professions of choice, and the integrates practitioners into the recruitment, retention and educational process to achieve a coupled education, training and capacity development environment. A gradual and strategic elevation of the perception, both internal and external, of the trades, through a combination of increased capacity, mobility and accountability will attract high school students whose interests and scholarly record fall between the traditional trades/vocations and academically-based professions, and through inappropriate choices limit their career advancement potential, and elevate skill levels in the critical environmental and public health functions of the water and wastewater utility sector. In order to limit the hurdles associated with integrating regulatory, trade association and academic principles into a single, functional, coherent framework, {WTTI} is initially focused on Kentucky and Tennessee. However, as a demonstrably functional framework is put in place, extrapolating to address other regional policy, academic discipline and industrial sector issues becomes a logistical rather than conceptual challenge. Partnering utilities and municipalities are developing internship and co-operative educational opportunities to ensure work-based experiences for students in the program, while the trade associations have committed to developing scholarship programs to lessen the financial disincentive for potential students. Academic content is provided by core university faculty, while practitioner oriented content will be provided by qualified trade association and utility/municipality staff eligible for adjunct faculty status. Committed to the precept of open-knowledge, {WTTI} is extending and coupling an open-source hybrid practitioner cyber-collaboratory (based on Drupal) with an open-source course management system (Moodle) to integrate the learning environment with practitioners and enhance retention of both students and the retiring practitioner knowledge-base. All instructors (academic and practitioner) involved in the program will undergo collaborative professional development to ensure that they are receptive to the unique structure of the program. All aspects of the program will be available through this on-line environment, allowing current practitioners to participate both as mentors, and as students pursuing career advancement goals. Experiential components of the program include on-line virtual activities, as well as opportunities provided by partnering utilities and municipalities local to the student.},

	title = {Creating a Water and Wastewater Educational Program with Incorporated Experiential Training},
	url = {http://www.asee.org/public/conferences/8/papers/5150/download},
	abstract = {The {EPA} requires in the Final Guidelines for the Certification and Recertification of the Operators of Community and Nontransient Noncommunity Public Water Systems Notice (1999) that states and {US} territories establish some sort of experiential or on-the-job training requirement for incumbent water or wastewater operators before they can legally become licensed professionals. In fact, some states require the operator to possess an adequate amount of experience in real-time plant operations, in order to take the certification exam. However, many times utilities discover that after the duration of training has passed, the would-be operator still does not hold the knowledge needed to pass the certification exam. This presents a well-defined problem when attempting to establish a succession plan for future employment needs, an issue currently plaguing the water industry. A resolution of this issue will involve a training program that seeks to model a mix of educational and experiential components which will produce professionals that have attained sufficient academic and operational expertise. This will require facilitators on each wavelength, academic and industrial, to cooperate in order to achieve the desired outcome. One such program that is currently pursuing such a venture is the Water Training Institute ({WTI}). Created by funds garnered from the Advanced Technological Education ({ATE}) division of the National Science Foundation ({NSF}), the {WTI} program has sought to address the developing workforce needs of the industry by providing pertinent academic training for aspiring operators, all while striving for partnerships with both industrial and regulatory agencies. The {WTI} Steering Committee, a group comprised of educational, industrial, and regulatory experts, epitomizes the necessary cooperation to develop a viable training program. A by-product of such cooperation is a grouping of individual utilities, known as {UNet}, which have agreed to provide the experiential cornerstone of the educational framework by providing internship avenues for student within the {WTI} program. This service ensures that graduates of {WTI} are provided the obligatory experience required for professional licensure. These utilities, in effect, become the instructors of this internship and are given the ability to grade the intern’s performance and to provide an adequate amount of real-life experience to the intern, so that successful simulation of day-to-day operation can occur. Present day evolution of the program has continued by adapting a curricula designed to meet the needs of those who cannot participate in traditional formats. This new format, a modular, self- paced system dissects the original format, breaking the original semester-based format into smaller sub-sections. This grants a greater flexibility to those students that are currently working within the water industry, providing another avenue for a simultaneous educational/experiential curriculum. Interestingly, these internships have harbored not only experience for interns but have in some instances transitioned into fulltime positions with the utilities that have provided the internship.This construct is a win-win scenario for both the utility and student, and would not be possible without sufficient cooperation between all three branches comprising {WTI}.},

	title = {A Resource Centric Approach for Advancing Collaboration Through Hydrologic Data and Model Sharing},
	url = {http://academicworks.cuny.edu/cc_conf_hic/314/},
	abstract = {{HydroShare} is an online, collaborative system being developed for open sharing of hydrologic data and models. The goal of {HydroShare} is to enable scientists to easily discover and access hydrologic data and models, retrieve them to their desktop or perform analyses in a distributed computing environment that may include grid, cloud or high performance computing model instances as necessary. Scientists may also publish outcomes (data, results or models) into {HydroShare}, using the system as a collaboration platform for sharing data, models and analyses. {HydroShare} is expanding the data sharing capability of the {CUAHSI} Hydrologic Information System by broadening the classes of data accommodated, creating new capability to share models and model components, and taking advantage of emerging social media functionality to enhance information about and collaboration around hydrologic data and models. In an information system such as {HydroShare}, the way that information is represented, and exposed to programming interfaces, is fundamental in enhancing the functionality that can be supported. One of the fundamental concepts in {HydroShare} is that of a resource. In {HydroShare}, a resource serves, as the basic unit of content. The Resource Data Model supports specification of metadata common to all resources as well as creation of metadata and content specific to particular types of resources. Metadata are split into science and system metadata and are packaged in a format compatible with existing data repositories, such as {DataOne}. {HydroShare} resource types include different data types used in the hydrology community and also models and workflows. Another fundamental concept in {HydroShare} is that of a Party, representing a person or organization that may be a resource creator or contributor, or a system user or group with access privileges for resources. This paper describes the resource centric approach being used, presents the data models for resources and parties, and discusses the application programming interface functions used as a foundational interface layer in the architecture of the system for accessing resources.},

Water resources web apps fall outside of the capabilities of standard web development software, because of their spatial data components. These spatial data needs can be addressed using a combination of existing free and open source software ({FOSS}) for geographic information systems ({FOSS}4G) and {FOSS} for web development. However, the abundance of {FOSS} projects that are available can be overwhelming to new developers. In an effort to understand the web of {FOSS} features and capabilities, we reviewed many of the state-of-the-art {FOSS} software projects in the context of those that have been used to develop water resources web apps published in the peer-reviewed literature in the last decade (2004–2014).},

	abstract = {The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science Inc. ({CUAHSI}) hydrologic information system ({HIS}) is a widely-used service oriented system for time series data management. While this system is intended to empower the hydrologic sciences community with better data storage and distribution, it lacks support for the kind of `Web 2.0˝ collaboration and social-networking capabilities being used in other fields. This paper presents the design, development, and testing of a software extension of {CUAHSI}'s newest product, {HydroShare}. The extension integrates the existing {CUAHSI} {HIS} into {HydroShare}'s social hydrology architecture. With this extension, {HydroShare} provides integrated {HIS} time series with efficient archiving, discovery, and retrieval of the data, extensive creator and science metadata, scientific discussion and collaboration around the data and other basic social media features. {HydroShare} provides functionality for online social interaction and collaboration while the existing {HIS} provides the distributed data management and web services framework. The extension is expected to enable scientists to access and share both national- and lab-scale hydrologic time series datasets in a standards-based web services architecture combined with social media functionality developed specifically for the hydrologic sciences.The final version of this paper will be published as part of a Special Issue “Online Water Data Networks: methods, standards, tools, and technologies”, which will be published in early 2016.},

	url = {http://academicworks.cuny.edu/cc_conf_hic/311/},
	abstract = {{HydroShare} is an online, open-source, collaborative system being developed for sharing hydrologic data and models as part of the {NSF}'s Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation ({SI}2) program. The goal of {HydroShare} is to enable scientists to easily discover and access hydrologic data and models, retrieve them to their desktop, or perform analyses in a distributed computing environment that may include grid, cloud, or high performance computing. Scientists may also publish outcomes (data, results or models) into {HydroShare}, using the system as a collaboration platform for sharing data, models, and analyses. {HydroShare} involves a large distributed software development effort requiring collaboration between domain scientists, software engineers, and software developers across eight U.S. universities, {RENCI}, and {CUAHSI}. {HydroShare} expands the data sharing capabilities of the Hydrologic Information System of the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc. ({CUAHSI}): It broadens the classes of data accommodated, enables sharing of models and model components, and leverages social media functionality to enhance collaboration around hydrologic data and models. The {HydroShare} architecture is a stack of storage and computation, web services, and user applications. A content management system, Django+Mezzanine, provides user interface, search, social media functions, and services. A geospatial visualization and analysis component enables searching, visualizing, and analyzing geographic datasets. A web browser is the main interface to {HydroShare}, however a web services applications programming interface ({API}) supports access through {HydroDesktop} and other hydrologic modeling systems, and the architecture separates the interface layer and services layer exposing all functionality through these web services. This presentation will describe key components of {HydroShare} and discuss how {HydroShare} is designedto enable better hydrologic science concomitant with sustainable open-source software practices.},

	abstract = {Stimulating Active Learning in Hydrology Using Research-Driven, Web- based Learning {ModulesThe} traditional approach to undergraduate hydrology and water resource education is textbookbased and relies on idealized examples of specific engineering applications and unit processes,rather than examining the contextual relations in the processes and the dynamics connectingclimate and ecosystems. Recent research advances in hydrology have resulted in newobservational settings, instrumentation, modeling techniques and hydro-informatics and datasharing technologies. This study seeks to address the needed paradigm shift in undergraduateeducation of engineering hydrology and water resources education to reflect parallel advances inresearch and technology.This paper presents a set of learning modules that are case-based, data and simulation driven anddelivered via a web user interface. The modules are based on real-world case studies from threeregional scale ecosystems, Coastal Louisiana, Florida Everglades, and Utah Great Salt {LakeBasin}. These three hydro-systems provide concepts and scenarios provide unique learningopportunities on topics such as regional-scale budget analysis, hydrologic effects of human andnatural changes, climate-hydrology teleconnections and water resource management scenarios(see next page for graphical illustration). The overall theme of the coastal Louisiana modules isin coastal restoration and the impacts of future restoration/protection engineering projects on theecosystem and the ecological and economical services it provides. The Utah Great Salt {LakeBasin} modules include concepts related to snowmelt driven ecosystems, terminal lakewatersheds, and flood prevention. The Florida Everglades modules cover processes that connectthe hydrology of the ecosystem to large-scale climatic teleconnections and implications for waterand ecological resource management. Each learning module is a self-contained case-studyfocusing on a real-world problem. Each module begins with an introduction to theengineering/environmental problem at hand, and then presents an investigation of the basicfeatures of the hydrologic setting and its main characteristics. The module then takes the studentsthrough an investigative process of the different solutions proposed for the problem and asks theto examine different design alternatives using data analysis, as well as model simulations. Insome cases, the students setup and run their own computer models, and in other cases they useresults from a pre-run set of simulations. To promote active learning, each module has a set ofstudent-focused activities with specific tasks and deliverables. The use of observational andexperimental data augment the use of simulation data and lead to an appreciation of the naturalvariability of hydrologic processes and the difficulties associated with using models to representsuch complex systems. The place-based nature of the modules and the hands-on active learningactivities provide a real-world context, stimulate student learning, and provide a resource for thedevelopment of practical skills as well as knowledge fundamental to engineering practice.Module effectiveness is assessed through an improvement-focused evaluation model using amixed-method research approach guiding data collection. Both qualitative and quantitative dataare collected through student learning data, product analysis, stakeholder surveys, and staffinterviews. The paper presents evaluation of program fidelity, effectiveness, student learning,and potential for adaptation.

	abstract = {The mapped rivers and streams of the contiguous United States are available in a geographic information system ({GIS}) dataset called National Hydrography Dataset Plus ({NHDPlus}). This hydrographic dataset has about 3 million river and water body reaches along with information on how they are connected into networks. The U.S. Geological Survey ({USGS}) National Water Information System ({NWIS}) provides streamflow observations at about 20 thousand gauges located on the {NHDPlus} river network. A river network model called Routing Application for Parallel Computation of Discharge ({RAPID}) is developed for the {NHDPlus} river network whose lateral inflow to the river network is calculated by a land surface model. A matrix-based version of the Muskingum method is developed herein, which {RAPID} uses to calculate flow and volume of water in all reaches of a river network with many thousands of reaches, including at ungauged locations. Gauges situated across river basins (not only at basin outlets) are used to automatically optimize the Muskingum parameters and to assess river flow computations, hence allowing the diagnosis of runoff computations provided by land surface models. {RAPID} is applied to the Guadalupe and San Antonio River basins in Texas, where flow wave celerities are estimated at multiple locations using 15-min data and can be reproduced reasonably with {RAPID}. This river model can be adapted for parallel computing and although the matrix method initially adds a large overhead, river flow results can be obtained faster than with the traditional Muskingum method when using a few processing cores, as demonstrated in a synthetic study using the upper Mississippi River basin.

	volume = {10},
	abstract = {With fast population growth and economic development in the {US}-Mexico Borderland, water diversion and usages has reduced the flow substantially in the Low Rio Grande River ({LRGR}). Tidal portion of the {LRGR} has posed an environmental drought issue since 1993 and the channel clogged with the invasion of non-native plants also causes environmental problems. As a result of the intensity of these natural and manmade factors, the Rio Grande stopped flowing to the sea in February 2001. The flows were reduced to a point that they were unable to push out the sand deposited at the mouth. Geomorphologic evolution in association with the fluvial process of the {LRGR} has received wide attention. The purpose of this study is to investigate the necessary flow to maintain the river mouth open to the Gulf of Mexico using integrated approach of remote sensing and numerical analysis. It also sheds lights on possible solutions in decision-making. The analysis starts with a geomorphologic analysis using satellite remote sensing imagery and historic flow rate assessment, followed by a two-dimensional, depth averaged, finite element numerical modeling analysis to simulate the hydrodynamics of the tidal portion of the {LRGR}. While Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus ({ETM}+) satellite imagery and Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles ({DOQs}) were used for the geomorphologic investigation, Research Management Associates ({RMA}-2) software and Surface Water Modeling System ({SMS} 8.0) were used for minimum stream flow rate analysis. Alternative geomorphic conditions were modeled and compared to the original case, where two simulation runs were established. The first one was designed in dealing with a more refined mesh; and the second was prepared for handling an increased discharge at the inflow boundary along with the investigation of shear stress. The study concludes that the peak shear stress increased with increasing discharge towards the mouth of the river and a 1.27 m3/s discharge is necessary to maintain the opening of the river mouth.},

	abstract = {A flocculent particle transport model was developed to aid in the assessment of particle mediated transport of pollutants in aquatic environments. The model included flocculation driven by binary inter-particle collisions and aggregate breakup driven by particle erosion. A framework was developed in conjunction with the predictive model to synthesize experimental data into the unknown model parameters. The basis of the method lies in the minimization of the variation between model predictions and observations via the iterative numerical determination of the functional minima of a residual function with respect to the parameters being determined. Model parameters have been estimated successfully for analytical and numerical solutions to dispersive, advective-dispersive and flocculent particle transport model equations. The effect of sampling or measurement error and initial parameter estimates on algorithm performance has been evaluated. This approach has been successfully applied to determine data requirements and constraints (quantity, quality and location) for measurement of hydrodynamic and transport characteristics of dye clouds and cohesive aquatic particles in laboratory mixed settling columns. A sensitivity analysis on limited particle size category resolution indicates that particle water column residence times may be significantly overestimated using distributions of less than 8 categories. A computer automated mixed settling column, designed to characterize the vertical transport of suspended particulate material in turbulent aquatic environments, was constructed to verify and calibrate the flocculent transport model within the parameter estimation framework. Dye studies were conducted for hydrodynamic characterization of the column. Continuous transmissometer data taken at various depths in the column were used to extract dispersion coefficients from the dispersive transport model coupled to the parameter estimation framework. Non-flocculent silica particles between 0.5 and 40μm in diameter were used for advection dominant transport studies and column verification. Particle transport studies were conducted on flocculent estuarine sediment particles ranging from 2 to 50μm in diameter. The model was calibrated using time series particle size distributions extracted from samples taken from the column at different depths and times.},

	abstract = {The Center for Water Resource Studies and the Bowling Green Community College of Western Kentucky University has formed a partnership to address a Water \& Wastewater Operator/Technician shortage anticipated over the next few years as "Baby Boomers" retire. The Water and Wastewater Technician Training Institute ({WTTI}, pronounced "witty"), is a partnership with the employment sector (a growing number of water \& wastewater utilities/municipalities/districts), state primacy agencies and technical assistance/trade associations to refine an industry needs driven curriculum that utilizes on-line course delivery to provide options for both traditional \& non-traditional students. The partnership is revitalizing an existing Associates Degree program entitled “Water Utilities Management" and integrating 4-year transitions through formal articulation agreements. {WTTI} takes a pedagogical approach to elevating and transforming the water and wastewater operator positions from trades of last resort, to professions of choice, and the integrates practitioners into the recruitment, retention and educational process to achieve a coupled education, training and capacity development environment. A gradual and strategic elevation of the perception, both internal and external, of the trades, through a combination of increased capacity, mobility and accountability will attract high school students whose interests and scholarly record fall between the traditional trades/vocations and academically-based professions, and through inappropriate choices limit their career advancement potential, and elevate skill levels in the critical environmental and public health functions of the water and wastewater utility sector. In order to limit the hurdles associated with integrating regulatory, trade association and academic principles into a single, functional, coherent framework, {WTTI} is initially focused on Kentucky and Tennessee. However, as a demonstrably functional framework is put in place, extrapolating to address other regional policy, academic discipline and industrial sector issues becomes a logistical rather than conceptual challenge. Partnering utilities and municipalities are developing internship and co-operative educational opportunities to ensure work-based experiences for students in the program, while the trade associations have committed to developing scholarship programs to lessen the financial disincentive for potential students. Academic content is provided by core university faculty, while practitioner oriented content will be provided by qualified trade association and utility/municipality staff eligible for adjunct faculty status. Committed to the precept of open-knowledge, {WTTI} is extending and coupling an open-source hybrid practitioner cyber-collaboratory (based on Drupal) with an open-source course management system (Moodle) to integrate the learning environment with practitioners and enhance retention of both students and the retiring practitioner knowledge-base. All instructors (academic and practitioner) involved in the program will undergo collaborative professional development to ensure that they are receptive to the unique structure of the program. All aspects of the program will be available through this on-line environment, allowing current practitioners to participate both as mentors, and as students pursuing career advancement goals. Experiential components of the program include on-line virtual activities, as well as opportunities provided by partnering utilities and municipalities local to the student.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess feasibility and utility of different uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques in multimedia environmental applications. Sensitivity analysis techniques considered here include Plackett-Burman technique, response-surface methodology, and first order analysis. Uncertainty techniques include Monte-carlo analysis and point estimate method. These techniques were used to propagate uncertainty in these models assuming ±10\% (local scale) and ±50\% (global scale) uncertainty and variability in the inputs. The analysis was carried out for chlorobenzene and Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate ({LAS}) two chemicals exhibiting volatile and non-volatile tendencies respectively. The results indicate that for the conditions employed in this study, all the sensitivity techniques highlighted similar sensitive parameters. Plackett-Burman method is found to be fairly simple tool to identify key inputs, however, it does not account for interaction effects. Fractional factorial method provides this information but it is more complex and time-consuming. Interaction effects can be captured using response-surface method, which is comparatively less complex and hence it may be more preferable in risk-based decision-making. Point estimate method and Monte-Carlo analysis quantify the uncertainty in outputs and give almost similar results. Uncertainty in interactions of inputs is high on global scale for both chemicals, as demonstrated by Monte-Carlo analysis. Monte-Carlo analysis can be applied in combination with first order method to quantify uncertainty in outputs. This information could be useful in risk-based decision-making as the variations in the parameter interactions are significant.},

The model was developed for the part of the river segment ’Rio Grande below Amistad Reservoir (2304)’ for the years 1993-1994. Existing data was used to calibrate the surface flow. The first step towards determining feasibility of the model i.e. calibration of the surface flow or water balance, was successfully completed. The project demonstrated that by with some limitations, {BASINS} and {WinHSPF} could be applied to the region. It also showed the necessity of more adequate data from U.S. and Mexican side of the river for more accurate results.},

	abstract = {In response to the needs for long-term water quality monitoring, one of the most significant challenges currently facing the water industry is to investigate the sensor placement strategies with modern concepts of and approaches to risk management. Most of the previous research mainly focuses on using optimization models to deal with small-scale drinking water networks. Yet the challenge of {NP} complete when handling large-scale networks can never be overcome. This study develops a rule-based expert system ({RBES}) to generate sensor deployment strategies with no computational burden as we oftentimes encountered via various types of optimization analyses. Two rules, including the accessibility and complexity rules, were derived to address the characteristics of effectiveness and efficiency required for sensor deployment in these networks. To retrieve the information of population exposure, the well-calibrated {EPANET} model was applied for the vulnerability assessment leading to the derivation of the accessibility rule whereas the graph theory was employed to retrieve the complexity rule eliminating the need to deal with temporal variability. Comparisons between this new expert system and 14 existing optimization and heuristic models confirm that the newly developed expert system in this paper can always compete with most of the optimization models. With no computational burden, the {RBES} that is designed to promote health risk management could also be applicable to deal with similar applications in large-scale drinking water distribution networks.},

Microcosm studies were conducted, and weathered Arabian light crude oil was the hydrocarbon used in the experiments. After 105 days of study, soils with added ammonium phosphate showed a greater degradation than the control soils with no added nutrients. Residual oil showed depletion of n-C17 and n-C18 (relative to hopane) in the nutrient series to be 1.3 times greater than that of the control series. Determination of first order depletion constants, k, showed treatment rate constants significantly larger than the rate constants for the control series.},

	abstract = {Many models or algorithms have been suggested for sensor placement in the drinking water distribution networks, such as genetic algorithms, multiobjective optimization models, and heuristic methods. Because these models or algorithms have high computational demands, however, the requirement of expensive technical computing software is unavoidable. This study presents a rule-based decision support system ({RBDSS}) to analyze and generate a set of sensor placement locations and compares the performance against 10 optimization models based on four indexes. Our findings show that the {RBDSS} demands relatively lower computational time and still exhibits outstanding performance in terms of all our indexes when dealing with a large-scale complex drinking water network.},

	abstract = {Use of sewage sludge on land is effective for improving soil structure and enhancing vegetation. The addition of sewage sludge provides organic matter and nutrients for growth of Bermudagrass. The study was performed to identify optimal sewage sludge application rates. A series of 6 experiments was designed to evaluate three rates of wet sewage sludge application. The experimental period was 5 months. Soil {pH} values decreased significantly in sludge amended columns. The highest rate of sludge application decreased to a {pH} of 7.3, whereas unamended columns had a {pH} of 8.8. Bermudagrass proliferated in sludge amended columns. Vegetation growth was greater in the highest rate of sludge application, but the lowest rate produced more root biomass. The lowest rate of sludge amended columns also maintained a low hydraulic conductivity (below 0.10 m/s) throughout the experimental period. The amended columns with no grass had a hydraulic conductivity as low as 0.03 m/s. The experiment provides a basis for future field-scale application of sewage sludge.},

A part of the Gulf of Mexico was also included in the mesh because tidal water affects the flow of the river, especially near the mouth. Boundary conditions were designated both by inflow (constant at upstream boundary in the study domain) and by the water surface elevation (dynamic head) at a radial distance of one mile from the mouth. The model output at each time step specified is comprised of water surface elevation and horizontal velocity. The animation of the water velocity showing the water flow inside the mesh and the flow trace were created through the post-processing attribute of {SMS}. {RMA}-2 could be used effectively to model the hydrodynamics of the tidal portion. However due to the unavailability of additional data set, the simulated values could not be verified with data from a different source.},

The water quality in this region has been deteriorating steadily, and there are competing needs for the surface water in the basin. The primary aim of this project was to determine the feasibility of {BASINS} and {WinHSPF} (Windows interface of {HSPF}) model to assess the water quality of the Lower Rio Grande. {WinHSPF} is a planning level watershed model that integrates both point and non-point sources. The model was developed for the part of the river segment ’Rio Grande below Amistad Reservoir (2304)’ for the years 1993-1994. Existing data was used to calibrate the surface flow. The first step towards determining feasibility of the model i.e. calibration of the surface flow or water balance, was successfully completed. The project demonstrated that by with some limitations, {BASINS} and {WinHSPF} could be applied to the region. It also showed the necessity of more adequate data from U.S. and Mexican side of the river for more accurate results.},

Our findings show that the {RBDSS} demands relatively lower computational time and still exhibits outstanding performance in terms of all our indexes when dealing with a large-scale complex drinking water network.},

	abstract = {In response to the needs for long-term water quality monitoring, one of the most significant challenges currently facing the water industry is to investigate the sensor placement strategies with modern concepts of and approaches to risk management. Most of the previous research mainly focuses on using optimization models to deal with small-scale drinking water networks. Yet the challenge of {NP} complete when handling large-scale networks can never be overcome. This study develops a rule-based expert system ({RBES}) to generate sensor deployment strategies with no computational burden as we oftentimes encountered via various types of optimization analyses. Two rules, including the accessibility and complexity rules, were derived to address the characteristics of effectiveness and efficiency required for sensor deployment in these networks. To retrieve the information of population exposure, the well-calibrated {EPANET} model was applied for the vulnerability assessment leading to the derivation of the accessibility rule whereas the graph theory was employed to retrieve the complexity rule eliminating the need to deal with temporal variability. Comparisons between this new expert system and 14 existing optimization and heuristic models confirm that the newly developed expert system in this paper can always compete with most of the optimization models. With no computational burden, the {RBES} that is designed to promote health risk management could also be applicable to deal with similar applications in large-scale drinking water distribution networks.},

The addition of sewage sludge provides organic matter and nutrients for growth of Bermudagrass. The study was performed to identify optimal sewage sludge application rates. A series of 6 experiments was designed to evaluate three rates of wet sewage sludge application. The experimental period was 5 months. Soil {pH} values decreased significantly in sludge amended columns. The highest rate of sludge application decreased to a {pH} of 7.3, whereas unamended columns had a {pH} of 8.8. Bermudagrass proliferated in sludge amended columns. Vegetation growth was greater in the highest rate of sludge application, but the lowest rate produced more root biomass. The lowest rate of sludge amended columns also maintained a low hydraulic conductivity (below 0.10 m/s) throughout the experimental period. The amended columns with no grass had a hydraulic conductivity as low as 0.03 m/s. The experiment provides a basis for future field-scale application of sewage sludge.},

Microcosm studies were conducted, and weathered Arabian light crude oil was the hydrocarbon used in the experiments. After 105 days of study, soils with added ammonium phosphate showed a greater degradation than the control soils with no added nutrients. Residual oil showed depletion of n-C17 and n-C18 (relative to hopane) in the nutrient series to be 1.3 times greater than that of the control series. Determination of first order depletion constants, k, showed treatment rate constants significantly larger than the rate constants for the control series.},

A part of the Gulf of Mexico was also included in the mesh because tidal water affects the flow of the river, especially near the mouth. Boundary conditions were designated both by inflow (constant at upstream boundary in the study domain) and by the water surface elevation (dynamic head) at a radial distance of one mile from the mouth. The model output at each time step specified is comprised of water surface elevation and horizontal velocity. The animation of the water velocity showing the water flow inside the mesh and the flow trace were created through the post-processing attribute of {SMS}. {RMA}-2 could be used effectively to model the hydrodynamics of the tidal portion. However due to the unavailability of additional data set, the simulated values could not be verified with data from a different source.},

These rapidly multiplying colonias, from a Spanish term for neighborhoods, are settlements of varying size located along the border. Along the American side of the Texas-Mexico border alone, there are approximately 1800 colonias--the largest number of any border state--most of which lack basic water and sewer systems, paved roads, and safe and sanitary housing. Promotoras, from a Spanish term for lay community educators, are community leaders who live in the colonias and build important bridges between residents and the federal and state bureaucracies. These women have been trained to introduce their neighbors to state "systems" of government, education, and medical and social services that otherwise may lie out of reach. Promotoras are able to "translate" this training into culturally meaningful instruction that empowers community self-development. When neighbors teach neighbors, the message is received with greater trust and readiness to act.},

Despite the availability of high-capacity connections, scientists struggle with inadequate cyberinfrastructure that cripples data transfer performance, and impedes scientific progress. The Science {DMZ} paradigm comprises a proven set of network design patterns that collectively address these problems for scientists. We explain the Science {DMZ} model, including network architecture, system configuration, cybersecurity, and performance tools, that creates an optimized network environment for science. We describe use cases from universities, supercomputing centers and research laboratories, highlighting the effectiveness of the Science {DMZ} model in diverse operational settings. In all, the Science {DMZ} model is a solid platform that supports any science workflow, and flexibly accommodates emerging network technologies. As a result, the Science {DMZ} vastly improves collaboration, accelerating scientific discovery.},

	abstract = {It is difficult for students to understand historical settings, connect to today's world, interpret and appreciate scientists' efforts within current perspectives. Empathizing with historical characters and events can mediate understanding nature of physics for students. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of history of science on students' empathy with the historical characters and the events. With regards of socio-cultural theory, empathy was defined as a cultural tool, which mediates between students and the science society. The study was conducted in a private high school with participation of twenty-one 9th grade students in physics class for the unit of The Nature of Physics. A qualitative case-study method was employed. Data resources were video and audio recordings, field notes, students' tasks, interviews, and surveys. After transcribing and categorizing, the data were analyzed and patterns were organized. The findings supported eight aspects of empathy: Making Personal Connections, Imagination, Identification, Humanization, Understanding the Events, Understanding Different Perspectives, Understanding the Tentativeness of the Conclusions and Taking Perspectives. The results supported that students could interact with the culture of science with the use of the aspects of historical empathy. The use of the aspects of empathy attracted students' interest in physics lesson. The results are also promising for students' understanding nature of science.},

Natural disasters will inevitably continue to occur, but by understanding the concept of resiliency as well as the factors that lead to it, communities can minimize their vulnerabilities and increase their resilience.? In this volume, editors Naim Kapucu, Christopher V. Hawkins, and Fernando I. Rivera gather an impressive array of scholars to provide a much needed re-think to the topic disaster resiliency. Previous research on the subject has mainly focused on case studies, but this book offers a more systematic and empirical assessment of resiliency, while at the same time delving into new areas of exploration, including vulnerabilities of mobile home parks, the importance of asset mapping, and the differences between rural and urban locations. Employing a variety of statistical techniques and applying these to disasters in the United States and worldwide, this book examines resiliency through comparative methods which examine public management and policy, community planning and development, and, on the individual level, the ways in which culture, socio-economic status, and social networks contribute to resiliency.

Design included selecting the size of the mesocosm and incorporating hydrological and soil features of a wetland environment. The mesocosm was subjected to a semidiurnal tidal cycle for three months to allow for acclimation prior to testing. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are essential elements for plant growth. Their availability determines the amount of organic matter available to support food webs. For this reason nitrate, phosphorus and total kjeldahl nitrogen were measured in the gravity outflow water, reservoir water and the soil. Biomass, a quantitative measure of the amount of living material present, was monitored in the both the gravity outflow and reservoir water as well as in the plants in the mesocosm. Since microbe biomass in water is difficult to determine, microbial biomass was correlated to total extractable adenosinetriphosphate. The precision of the P-value increased with time for all parameters analyzed across the mesocosm.},

Dynamic sorption of these soils was studied at different concentration for two inorganic arsenic species (arsenate and arsenite). Freundlich and Langmuir Isotherms were evaluated from equilibrium studies on all the three types of soil considering both arsenite and arsenate. Column studies were also conducted on the soils, to simulate the actual field conditions. Three concentrations were considered for the arsenate species. An average concentration was considered for arsenite. Victoria which has more organic, ferrous and clay content had showed the greatest sorption followed by Orelia and Willacy. Sorption of arsenate was greater than arsenite in all types of soils. Increase in sorption of both arsenate and arsenite was observed with increase in initial applied concentration. Break through curves from the column studies, indicated a steady state condition. In Column depth profile studies showed that Orelia and Willacy behaved similarly where as, Victoria had a large drop in arsenic concentration across the profile.},

	abstract = {The Center for Water Resource Studies and the Bowling Green Community College of Western Kentucky University has formed a partnership to address a Water \& Wastewater Operator/Technician shortage anticipated over the next few years as "Baby Boomers" retire. The Water and Wastewater Technician Training Institute ({WTTI}, pronounced "witty"), is a partnership with the employment sector (a growing number of water \& wastewater utilities/municipalities/districts), state primacy agencies and technical assistance/trade associations to refine an industry needs driven curriculum that utilizes on-line course delivery to provide options for both traditional \& non-traditional students. The partnership is revitalizing an existing Associates Degree program entitled “Water Utilities Management" and integrating 4-year transitions through formal articulation agreements. {WTTI} takes a pedagogical approach to elevating and transforming the water and wastewater operator positions from trades of last resort, to professions of choice, and the integrates practitioners into the recruitment, retention and educational process to achieve a coupled education, training and capacity development environment. A gradual and strategic elevation of the perception, both internal and external, of the trades, through a combination of increased capacity, mobility and accountability will attract high school students whose interests and scholarly record fall between the traditional trades/vocations and academically-based professions, and through inappropriate choices limit their career advancement potential, and elevate skill levels in the critical environmental and public health functions of the water and wastewater utility sector. In order to limit the hurdles associated with integrating regulatory, trade association and academic principles into a single, functional, coherent framework, {WTTI} is initially focused on Kentucky and Tennessee. However, as a demonstrably functional framework is put in place, extrapolating to address other regional policy, academic discipline and industrial sector issues becomes a logistical rather than conceptual challenge. Partnering utilities and municipalities are developing internship and co-operative educational opportunities to ensure work-based experiences for students in the program, while the trade associations have committed to developing scholarship programs to lessen the financial disincentive for potential students. Academic content is provided by core university faculty, while practitioner oriented content will be provided by qualified trade association and utility/municipality staff eligible for adjunct faculty status. Committed to the precept of open-knowledge, {WTTI} is extending and coupling an open-source hybrid practitioner cyber-collaboratory (based on Drupal) with an open-source course management system (Moodle) to integrate the learning environment with practitioners and enhance retention of both students and the retiring practitioner knowledge-base. All instructors (academic and practitioner) involved in the program will undergo collaborative professional development to ensure that they are receptive to the unique structure of the program. All aspects of the program will be available through this on-line environment, allowing current practitioners to participate both as mentors, and as students pursuing career advancement goals. Experiential components of the program include on-line virtual activities, as well as opportunities provided by partnering utilities and municipalities local to the student.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess feasibility and utility of different uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques in multimedia environmental applications. Sensitivity analysis techniques considered here include Plackett-Burman technique, response-surface methodology, and first order analysis. Uncertainty techniques include Monte-carlo analysis and point estimate method. These techniques were used to propagate uncertainty in these models assuming ±10\% (local scale) and ±50\% (global scale) uncertainty and variability in the inputs. The analysis was carried out for chlorobenzene and Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate ({LAS}) two chemicals exhibiting volatile and non-volatile tendencies respectively. The results indicate that for the conditions employed in this study, all the sensitivity techniques highlighted similar sensitive parameters. Plackett-Burman method is found to be fairly simple tool to identify key inputs, however, it does not account for interaction effects. Fractional factorial method provides this information but it is more complex and time-consuming. Interaction effects can be captured using response-surface method, which is comparatively less complex and hence it may be more preferable in risk-based decision-making. Point estimate method and Monte-Carlo analysis quantify the uncertainty in outputs and give almost similar results. Uncertainty in interactions of inputs is high on global scale for both chemicals, as demonstrated by Monte-Carlo analysis. Monte-Carlo analysis can be applied in combination with first order method to quantify uncertainty in outputs. This information could be useful in risk-based decision-making as the variations in the parameter interactions are significant.},

The model was developed for the part of the river segment ’Rio Grande below Amistad Reservoir (2304)’ for the years 1993-1994. Existing data was used to calibrate the surface flow. The first step towards determining feasibility of the model i.e. calibration of the surface flow or water balance, was successfully completed. The project demonstrated that by with some limitations, {BASINS} and {WinHSPF} could be applied to the region. It also showed the necessity of more adequate data from U.S. and Mexican side of the river for more accurate results.},

	abstract = {In response to the needs for long-term water quality monitoring, one of the most significant challenges currently facing the water industry is to investigate the sensor placement strategies with modern concepts of and approaches to risk management. Most of the previous research mainly focuses on using optimization models to deal with small-scale drinking water networks. Yet the challenge of {NP} complete when handling large-scale networks can never be overcome. This study develops a rule-based expert system ({RBES}) to generate sensor deployment strategies with no computational burden as we oftentimes encountered via various types of optimization analyses. Two rules, including the accessibility and complexity rules, were derived to address the characteristics of effectiveness and efficiency required for sensor deployment in these networks. To retrieve the information of population exposure, the well-calibrated {EPANET} model was applied for the vulnerability assessment leading to the derivation of the accessibility rule whereas the graph theory was employed to retrieve the complexity rule eliminating the need to deal with temporal variability. Comparisons between this new expert system and 14 existing optimization and heuristic models confirm that the newly developed expert system in this paper can always compete with most of the optimization models. With no computational burden, the {RBES} that is designed to promote health risk management could also be applicable to deal with similar applications in large-scale drinking water distribution networks.},

Our findings show that the {RBDSS} demands relatively lower computational time and still exhibits outstanding performance in terms of all our indexes when dealing with a large-scale complex drinking water network.},

The addition of sewage sludge provides organic matter and nutrients for growth of Bermudagrass. The study was performed to identify optimal sewage sludge application rates. A series of 6 experiments was designed to evaluate three rates of wet sewage sludge application. The experimental period was 5 months. Soil {pH} values decreased significantly in sludge amended columns. The highest rate of sludge application decreased to a {pH} of 7.3, whereas unamended columns had a {pH} of 8.8. Bermudagrass proliferated in sludge amended columns. Vegetation growth was greater in the highest rate of sludge application, but the lowest rate produced more root biomass. The lowest rate of sludge amended columns also maintained a low hydraulic conductivity (below 0.10 m/s) throughout the experimental period. The amended columns with no grass had a hydraulic conductivity as low as 0.03 m/s. The experiment provides a basis for future field-scale application of sewage sludge.},

After 105 days of study, soils with added ammonium phosphate showed a greater degradation than the control soils with no added nutrients. Residual oil showed depletion of n-C17 and n-C18 (relative to hopane) in the nutrient series to be 1.3 times greater than that of the control series.

Their availability determines the amount of organic matter available to support food webs. For this reason nitrate, phosphorus and total kjeldahl nitrogen were measured in the gravity outflow water, reservoir water and the soil. Biomass, a quantitative measure of the amount of living material present, was monitored in the both the gravity outflow and reservoir water as well as in the plants in the mesocosm. Since microbe biomass in water is difficult to determine, microbial biomass was correlated to total extractable adenosinetriphosphate. The precision of the P-value increased with time for all parameters analyzed across the mesocosm.},

Column studies were also conducted on the soils, to simulate the actual field conditions. Three concentrations were considered for the arsenate species. An average concentration was considered for arsenite. Victoria which has more organic, ferrous and clay content had showed the greatest sorption followed by Orelia and Willacy. Sorption of arsenate was greater than arsenite in all types of soils. Increase in sorption of both arsenate and arsenite was observed with increase in initial applied concentration. Break through curves from the column studies, indicated a steady state condition. In Column depth profile studies showed that Orelia and Willacy behaved similarly where as, Victoria had a large drop in arsenic concentration across the profile.},

Parameters measured during this study were flow rate, pressure increase, and media performance. 80\% of {CEO} was removed and a final average {TSS} concentration of 40 mg/L was achieved using a combination of Mixed Media (coarse sand, anthracite and gamet), {PM}-100 ® (anthracite and clay), and activated carbon. Results demonstrated the efficiency of the filtration media in the removal of {CEO} and {TSS}. The correct combination of filtration media could reduce {CEO} and {TSS} from the wastewater at {COSS} to levels which meet {TNRCC} guidelines.},

	abstract = {A quasi steady state heat transfer computer model was developed to predict heat transfer in the walls of a residential building, on an hourly basis. This model was designed to model the heat transfer of a whole residential building by compiling it with an existing attic transient heat and mass transfer model. This thesis compares the predictions of the computer model with experimental data to determine the validity of the model. This computer model can also be used to estimate the total amount of heat reduction and energy savings in room cooling and heating loads when using radiant barriers. Ambient temperature, hour of the day, and month of the year were input and hourly thermal load calculations were performed using the heat balance approach. Other inputs such as insulation data, ambient temperature, inside room temperature, and air velocity were input to the model. The output of the model recorded the total heat flux on the roof and walls; it also estimated the total amount of heat reduction and energy savings in room heating and cooling produced by the use of radiant barriers. The model predictions were validated by comparing the prediction of the model with experimental values from a test house located at the Texas A\&M University, Kingsville campus. Model differed by 6\% when compared to the experimental data. This model was created to test the performance of radiant barriers more accurately; however, due to lack of time, test on radiant barriers has not been completed. Thus, the model could not be validated nor used for this purpose at the present time. In the future, the model will be used to test radiant barriers. Computer simulations were used to predict the total wall heat flux by taking one year’s ambient temperature data for a fixed location from the Typical Meteorological Year ({TMY}) files. Model also predicted the hourly heat flux data for different insulation levels.},

Simple network represented the dredged channels and the complex networks included the wider and shallow sections. Model sensitivity analysis indicated that the river stretch, due to its depth, lack of vegetation, and sediment-removal, did not offer significant resistance to flow. Wind velocity and direction affected the flow pattern significantly. Tidal influence was considerable and the wider and shallow portions had very little movement. The complex network exhibited some deviations in flow, at certain segments due to the inadequacies of applying a 1-D model to a 2-D system.},

	abstract = {Due to recently enhanced understanding of particle aggregation in aquatic environments, we now have four possible approaches to modeling coagulation: the traditional Euclidean rectilinear, the Euclidean curvilinear, the fractal rectilinear, and the fractal curvilinear approaches. The primary purpose of this research is to investigate which model among these best predicts observations of particle size distribution ({PSD}) and its evolution. In order to do this, two fractal coagulation kinetic models (rectilinear and curvilinear) were developed. The models are generalized models, meaning the Euclidean models are a subset of the fractal models, and have one spatial dimension incorporating sedimentation and vertical dispersion as well as coagulation. The second phase of this work was a comparison of the four models based on a series of observed {PSD} data from a 2-m settling column using estuarine sediment particles. Nonlinear parameter estimation was performed to estimate two free parameters for the fractal models (the fractal dimension, \$D{\textbackslash}{sbF},\$ and the collision efficiency factor, \${\textbackslash}alpha),\$ and one free parameter, \${\textbackslash}alpha,\$ for the Euclidean models. Compared with the observed {PSD}, the simulation showed that the fractal rectilinear model was best among the competing models, and that this model fit better for the larger size particles. The estimated \$D{\textbackslash}{sbF}\$ was between 2.6 and 3.0. The Euclidean curvilinear model underestimated the collision rates even with an α of 1.0, and the resultant fitting was worse than the Euclidean rectilinear case, contrary to the general belief. The research demonstrated that the α’s were calculated to have multiple values, depending on the coagulation models assumed. This finding appears to be significant because α is currently used as a single value based on the conventional Euclidean rectilinear model.},

The behavior of the inorganic species studied, however, such as the total dissolved solids was consistent with the solvent and solute flux predicted by the fundamental diffusion model equations.

Each of these hydrologic phenomena was represented by a specific equation. The values of the variable parameters in the equations were determined by sensitivity analysis. After selecting the values of the parameters a quadratic equation was derived. This equation represents the relationship between the depth of water in the channels and the change in the volume of water storage per unit time in the Santa Gertrudis Creek wetlands for the period of February-April. Using the data obtained from the field and the laboratory, the model was run for a year. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a nutrient cycling model of the wetlands.},

	abstract = {In-stream water quality is an important component of watershed management as it defines the intended use. Participatory watershed management involving multiple stakeholders is gaining acceptance for developing waste load allocations ({WLA}). {WLAs} specify the maximum pollutant loadings from permitted compliance systems and are a function of both science and policy. A goal-programming based simulation-optimization approach was developed to assess regional-scale assimilative capacity of a stream. This approach accounts for the heterogeneous nature of the water body regarding flow and non-point source loadings and identifies those sub-regions that are critically stressed. The model was used to develop an optimal loading scheme for the Arroyo Colorado river watershed. A Monte-Carlo reliability analysis was carried out to assess the risks associated with choosing the optimal loading scheme under parametric uncertainty. Ten different models were developed to assess the reliability of the optimal loading scheme under structural uncertainty. The results indicated that San Benito consistently had the highest probability of exceeding the biochemical oxygen demand ({BOD}) standard; similarly, {McAllen} had the highest probability of failing to meet the dissolved oxygen ({DO}) standard in the Arroyo Colorado river watershed. The uncertainties arising from non-point source ({NPS}) estimation schemes were also evaluated and the Modified Rational method provided conservative estimates. Other decision support tools for evaluating various policy options were also developed. A framework for ranking model conceptualizations under stakeholder defined criteria was developed using fuzzy {TOPSIS} technique. The results indicated that inclusion of sediment oxygen demand was important for conservatism. Similarly, the impacts of future urbanization were also evaluated by developing plausible land use land cover projections in {GIS}. Characterizing urbanization was critical for establishing optimal {BOD} loadings regardless of the chosen conceptual model. An integrated probabilistic–fuzzy preference maximization model was developed and illustrated to simultaneously reconcile statistical randomness in biokinetic parameters and vague stakeholder preferences. This model provided equitable loading for each permitted compliance system. The developed decision support system tools are useful for fostering scientifically–credible, risk-informed and consensus-oriented waste load allocation schemes.},

	abstract = {The {EPA} requires in the Final Guidelines for the Certification and Recertification of the Operators of Community and Nontransient Noncommunity Public Water Systems Notice (1999) that states and {US} territories establish some sort of experiential or on-the-job training requirement for incumbent water or wastewater operators before they can legally become licensed professionals. In fact, some states require the operator to possess an adequate amount of experience in real-time plant operations, in order to take the certification exam. However, many times utilities discover that after the duration of training has passed, the would-be operator still does not hold the knowledge needed to pass the certification exam. This presents a well-defined problem when attempting to establish a succession plan for future employment needs, an issue currently plaguing the water industry. A resolution of this issue will involve a training program that seeks to model a mix of educational and experiential components which will produce professionals that have attained sufficient academic and operational expertise. This will require facilitators on each wavelength, academic and industrial, to cooperate in order to achieve the desired outcome. One such program that is currently pursuing such a venture is the Water Training Institute ({WTI}). Created by funds garnered from the Advanced Technological Education ({ATE}) division of the National Science Foundation ({NSF}), the {WTI} program has sought to address the developing workforce needs of the industry by providing pertinent academic training for aspiring operators, all while striving for partnerships with both industrial and regulatory agencies. The {WTI} Steering Committee, a group comprised of educational, industrial, and regulatory experts, epitomizes the necessary cooperation to develop a viable training program. A by-product of such cooperation is a grouping of individual utilities, known as {UNet}, which have agreed to provide the experiential cornerstone of the educational framework by providing internship avenues for student within the {WTI} program. This service ensures that graduates of {WTI} are provided the obligatory experience required for professional licensure. These utilities, in effect, become the instructors of this internship and are given the ability to grade the intern’s performance and to provide an adequate amount of real-life experience to the intern, so that successful simulation of day-to-day operation can occur. Present day evolution of the program has continued by adapting a curricula designed to meet the needs of those who cannot participate in traditional formats. This new format, a modular, self- paced system dissects the original format, breaking the original semester-based format into smaller sub-sections. This grants a greater flexibility to those students that are currently working within the water industry, providing another avenue for a simultaneous educational/experiential curriculum. Interestingly, these internships have harbored not only experience for interns but have in some instances transitioned into fulltime positions with the utilities that have provided the internship.This construct is a win-win scenario for both the utility and student, and would not be possible without sufficient cooperation between all three branches comprising {WTI}.},

	abstract = {The toxicities of crude oil and crude oil plus dispersant Water Accommodated Fractions ({WAFs}) were evaluated in three toxicity testing systems: spiked and continuous exposures to Mysidopsis bahia were tested in flow-through and static testing systems respectively; microbial toxicity was tested with Microbics Microtox\${\textbackslash}sp{\textbackslash}circler\$. Flourometry and {HPLC} were used to quantitate {WAF} concentrations of {PAHs} and {BTEX} respectively. The mechanically dispersed {WAFs} spiked exposure test resulted in a median lethal crude oil loading ({LL}50) = 3914 mg/L compared to a {LL}50 = 2766 mg/L for the continuous exposure assay. This data suggest that spiked exposures require higher {WAF} concentrations to achieve toxic responses similar to those due to continuous exposures. {PAH} data showed some correlation to aquatic toxicity data, while {BTEX} data showed no correlation. Microtox\${\textbackslash}sp{\textbackslash}circler\$ and fluorescence data revealed that chemically dispersed {WAF} {EC}50s were 2 to 29 greater than the mechanically dispersed {WAF} {EC}50s. This suggests that the chemically dispersed {WAFs} have a lower percentage of toxic components per unit concentration that the mechanically dispersed {WAFs}. No significant toxicity variance was observed between the two aquatic test systems and the microbial assay.},

The addition of sewage sludge provides organic matter and nutrients for growth of Bermudagrass. The study was performed to identify optimal sewage sludge application rates. A series of 6 experiments was designed to evaluate three rates of wet sewage sludge application. The experimental period was 5 months. Soil {pH} values decreased significantly in sludge amended columns. The highest rate of sludge application decreased to a {pH} of 7.3, whereas unamended columns had a {pH} of 8.8. Bermudagrass proliferated in sludge amended columns. Vegetation growth was greater in the highest rate of sludge application, but the lowest rate produced more root biomass. The lowest rate of sludge amended columns also maintained a low hydraulic conductivity (below 0.10 m/s) throughout the experimental period. The amended columns with no grass had a hydraulic conductivity as low as 0.03 m/s. The experiment provides a basis for future field-scale application of sewage sludge.},

Residual oil showed depletion of n-C17 and n-C18 (relative to hopane) in the nutrient series to be 1.3 times greater than that of the control series.

A part of the Gulf of Mexico was also included in the mesh because tidal water affects the flow of the river, especially near the mouth. Boundary conditions were designated both by inflow (constant at upstream boundary in the study domain) and by the water surface elevation (dynamic head) at a radial distance of one mile from the mouth. The model output at each time step specified is comprised of water surface elevation and horizontal velocity. The animation of the water velocity showing the water flow inside the mesh and the flow trace were created through the post-processing attribute of {SMS}. {RMA}-2 could be used effectively to model the hydrodynamics of the tidal portion. However due to the unavailability of additional data set, the simulated values could not be verified with data from a different source.},

For this reason nitrate, phosphorus and total kjeldahl nitrogen were measured in the gravity outflow water, reservoir water and the soil. Biomass, a quantitative measure of the amount of living material present, was monitored in the both the gravity outflow and reservoir water as well as in the plants in the mesocosm. Since microbe biomass in water is difficult to determine, microbial biomass was correlated to total extractable adenosinetriphosphate. The precision of the P-value increased with time for all parameters analyzed across the mesocosm.},

Column studies were also conducted on the soils, to simulate the actual field conditions. Three concentrations were considered for the arsenate species. An average concentration was considered for arsenite. Victoria which has more organic, ferrous and clay content had showed the greatest sorption followed by Orelia and Willacy. Sorption of arsenate was greater than arsenite in all types of soils. Increase in sorption of both arsenate and arsenite was observed with increase in initial applied concentration. Break through curves from the column studies, indicated a steady state condition. In Column depth profile studies showed that Orelia and Willacy behaved similarly where as, Victoria had a large drop in arsenic concentration across the profile.},

	abstract = {A two-dimensional depth averaged finite element hydrodynamic numeric model was created for simulation of the hydrodynamics of Baffin Bay, Texas using {RMA}-2 software. Surface Water Modeling System ({SMS} 6.0) was used to pre-process and post-process the data. The boundary conditions for the model assigned were the water inflow (upstream boundaries) and water surface elevation (head) specified at the mouth of Baffin Bay, which is the outflow (downstream boundary). The model input data were obtained from the published on-line data available from various agency and research institutes. The model output consisted of water surface elevation and velocity magnitude. The animation of the water velocity showing the water flow inside the bay was created. The sensitivity analysis on the model showed the response to the various values of input parameters. The most drastic effect on the model was due to the wind stress. The model was successfully simulated, however the simulated values could not be verified with data from a different source due to unavailability of such data set.},

	abstract = {A quasi steady state heat transfer computer model was developed to predict heat transfer in the walls of a residential building, on an hourly basis. This model was designed to model the heat transfer of a whole residential building by compiling it with an existing attic transient heat and mass transfer model. This thesis compares the predictions of the computer model with experimental data to determine the validity of the model. This computer model can also be used to estimate the total amount of heat reduction and energy savings in room cooling and heating loads when using radiant barriers. Ambient temperature, hour of the day, and month of the year were input and hourly thermal load calculations were performed using the heat balance approach. Other inputs such as insulation data, ambient temperature, inside room temperature, and air velocity were input to the model. The output of the model recorded the total heat flux on the roof and walls; it also estimated the total amount of heat reduction and energy savings in room heating and cooling produced by the use of radiant barriers. The model predictions were validated by comparing the prediction of the model with experimental values from a test house located at the Texas A\&M University, Kingsville campus. Model differed by 6\% when compared to the experimental data. This model was created to test the performance of radiant barriers more accurately; however, due to lack of time, test on radiant barriers has not been completed. Thus, the model could not be validated nor used for this purpose at the present time. In the future, the model will be used to test radiant barriers. Computer simulations were used to predict the total wall heat flux by taking one year’s ambient temperature data for a fixed location from the Typical Meteorological Year ({TMY}) files. Model also predicted the hourly heat flux data for different insulation levels.},

Simple network represented the dredged channels and the complex networks included the wider and shallow sections. Model sensitivity analysis indicated that the river stretch, due to its depth, lack of vegetation, and sediment-removal, did not offer significant resistance to flow. Wind velocity and direction affected the flow pattern significantly. Tidal influence was considerable and the wider and shallow portions had very little movement. The complex network exhibited some deviations in flow, at certain segments due to the inadequacies of applying a 1-D model to a 2-D system.},

	abstract = {Due to recently enhanced understanding of particle aggregation in aquatic environments, we now have four possible approaches to modeling coagulation: the traditional Euclidean rectilinear, the Euclidean curvilinear, the fractal rectilinear, and the fractal curvilinear approaches. The primary purpose of this research is to investigate which model among these best predicts observations of particle size distribution ({PSD}) and its evolution. In order to do this, two fractal coagulation kinetic models (rectilinear and curvilinear) were developed. The models are generalized models, meaning the Euclidean models are a subset of the fractal models, and have one spatial dimension incorporating sedimentation and vertical dispersion as well as coagulation. The second phase of this work was a comparison of the four models based on a series of observed {PSD} data from a 2-m settling column using estuarine sediment particles. Nonlinear parameter estimation was performed to estimate two free parameters for the fractal models (the fractal dimension, \$D{\textbackslash}{sbF},\$ and the collision efficiency factor, \${\textbackslash}alpha),\$ and one free parameter, \${\textbackslash}alpha,\$ for the Euclidean models. Compared with the observed {PSD}, the simulation showed that the fractal rectilinear model was best among the competing models, and that this model fit better for the larger size particles. The estimated \$D{\textbackslash}{sbF}\$ was between 2.6 and 3.0. The Euclidean curvilinear model underestimated the collision rates even with an α of 1.0, and the resultant fitting was worse than the Euclidean rectilinear case, contrary to the general belief. The research demonstrated that the α’s were calculated to have multiple values, depending on the coagulation models assumed. This finding appears to be significant because α is currently used as a single value based on the conventional Euclidean rectilinear model.},

The behavior of the inorganic species studied, however, such as the total dissolved solids was consistent with the solvent and solute flux predicted by the fundamental diffusion model equations. It appears that organic solute passage and/or rejection involved three possible mechanisms: convection, sieving, and diffusion.},

Each of these hydrologic phenomena was represented by a specific equation. The values of the variable parameters in the equations were determined by sensitivity analysis. After selecting the values of the parameters a quadratic equation was derived. This equation represents the relationship between the depth of water in the channels and the change in the volume of water storage per unit time in the Santa Gertrudis Creek wetlands for the period of February-April. Using the data obtained from the field and the laboratory, the model was run for a year. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a nutrient cycling model of the wetlands.},

	abstract = {In-stream water quality is an important component of watershed management as it defines the intended use. Participatory watershed management involving multiple stakeholders is gaining acceptance for developing waste load allocations ({WLA}). {WLAs} specify the maximum pollutant loadings from permitted compliance systems and are a function of both science and policy. A goal-programming based simulation-optimization approach was developed to assess regional-scale assimilative capacity of a stream. This approach accounts for the heterogeneous nature of the water body regarding flow and non-point source loadings and identifies those sub-regions that are critically stressed. The model was used to develop an optimal loading scheme for the Arroyo Colorado river watershed. A Monte-Carlo reliability analysis was carried out to assess the risks associated with choosing the optimal loading scheme under parametric uncertainty. Ten different models were developed to assess the reliability of the optimal loading scheme under structural uncertainty. The results indicated that San Benito consistently had the highest probability of exceeding the biochemical oxygen demand ({BOD}) standard; similarly, {McAllen} had the highest probability of failing to meet the dissolved oxygen ({DO}) standard in the Arroyo Colorado river watershed. The uncertainties arising from non-point source ({NPS}) estimation schemes were also evaluated and the Modified Rational method provided conservative estimates. Other decision support tools for evaluating various policy options were also developed. A framework for ranking model conceptualizations under stakeholder defined criteria was developed using fuzzy {TOPSIS} technique. The results indicated that inclusion of sediment oxygen demand was important for conservatism. Similarly, the impacts of future urbanization were also evaluated by developing plausible land use land cover projections in {GIS}. Characterizing urbanization was critical for establishing optimal {BOD} loadings regardless of the chosen conceptual model. An integrated probabilistic–fuzzy preference maximization model was developed and illustrated to simultaneously reconcile statistical randomness in biokinetic parameters and vague stakeholder preferences. This model provided equitable loading for each permitted compliance system. The developed decision support system tools are useful for fostering scientifically–credible, risk-informed and consensus-oriented waste load allocation schemes.},

	abstract = {The {EPA} requires in the Final Guidelines for the Certification and Recertification of the Operators of Community and Nontransient Noncommunity Public Water Systems Notice (1999) that states and {US} territories establish some sort of experiential or on-the-job training requirement for incumbent water or wastewater operators before they can legally become licensed professionals. In fact, some states require the operator to possess an adequate amount of experience in real-time plant operations, in order to take the certification exam. However, many times utilities discover that after the duration of training has passed, the would-be operator still does not hold the knowledge needed to pass the certification exam. This presents a well-defined problem when attempting to establish a succession plan for future employment needs, an issue currently plaguing the water industry. A resolution of this issue will involve a training program that seeks to model a mix of educational and experiential components which will produce professionals that have attained sufficient academic and operational expertise. This will require facilitators on each wavelength, academic and industrial, to cooperate in order to achieve the desired outcome. One such program that is currently pursuing such a venture is the Water Training Institute ({WTI}). Created by funds garnered from the Advanced Technological Education ({ATE}) division of the National Science Foundation ({NSF}), the {WTI} program has sought to address the developing workforce needs of the industry by providing pertinent academic training for aspiring operators, all while striving for partnerships with both industrial and regulatory agencies. The {WTI} Steering Committee, a group comprised of educational, industrial, and regulatory experts, epitomizes the necessary cooperation to develop a viable training program. A by-product of such cooperation is a grouping of individual utilities, known as {UNet}, which have agreed to provide the experiential cornerstone of the educational framework by providing internship avenues for student within the {WTI} program. This service ensures that graduates of {WTI} are provided the obligatory experience required for professional licensure. These utilities, in effect, become the instructors of this internship and are given the ability to grade the intern’s performance and to provide an adequate amount of real-life experience to the intern, so that successful simulation of day-to-day operation can occur. Present day evolution of the program has continued by adapting a curricula designed to meet the needs of those who cannot participate in traditional formats. This new format, a modular, self- paced system dissects the original format, breaking the original semester-based format into smaller sub-sections. This grants a greater flexibility to those students that are currently working within the water industry, providing another avenue for a simultaneous educational/experiential curriculum. Interestingly, these internships have harbored not only experience for interns but have in some instances transitioned into fulltime positions with the utilities that have provided the internship.This construct is a win-win scenario for both the utility and student, and would not be possible without sufficient cooperation between all three branches comprising {WTI}.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in water quality assessment is the development and implementation of the analysis tools. One has to perform a series of steps such as data mining, map generation and simulating and interpreting models. These isolated steps can lead to lack of integration and limited coordination. The objective of this research is to develop a multipurpose spatial decision support system where decision makers, stakeholders and public are provided with data, maps and assessment tools over the web. Temporal data is incorporated with Spatial System and are stored in a distributed database to test its adequacy over the web. Web based Geological Information System ({GIS}) was used to visualize and assess water quality over the web for an end user with minimum knowledge and computing experience. The Spatial Decision Support System was developed for this study focuses on the Lower Rio Grande river basin. Water quality data for the study region from various sources were obtained and stored in a relational database management system. The stored data was provided over the web using a graphical user interface with water quality assessment tools and tools to identify different management options. The availability of data and assessment tools over the web is expected to increase public participation in decision-making process and effectiveness of water quality assessment over the web.},

Flourometry and {HPLC} were used to quantitate {WAF} concentrations of {PAHs} and {BTEX} respectively. The mechanically dispersed {WAFs} spiked exposure test resulted in a median lethal crude oil loading ({LL}50) = 3914 mg/L compared to a {LL}50 = 2766 mg/L for the continuous exposure assay. This data suggest that spiked exposures require higher {WAF} concentrations to achieve toxic responses similar to those due to continuous exposures. {PAH} data showed some correlation to aquatic toxicity data, while {BTEX} data showed no correlation. Microtox\${\textbackslash}sp{\textbackslash}circler\$ and fluorescence data revealed that chemically dispersed {WAF} {EC}50s were 2 to 29 greater than the mechanically dispersed {WAF} {EC}50s. This suggests that the chemically dispersed {WAFs} have a lower percentage of toxic components per unit concentration that the mechanically dispersed {WAFs}.

	volume = {10},
	abstract = {With fast population growth and economic development in the {US}-Mexico Borderland, water diversion and usages has reduced the flow substantially in the Low Rio Grande River ({LRGR}). Tidal portion of the {LRGR} has posed an environmental drought issue since 1993 and the channel clogged with the invasion of non-native plants also causes environmental problems. As a result of the intensity of these natural and manmade factors, the Rio Grande stopped flowing to the sea in February 2001. The flows were reduced to a point that they were unable to push out the sand deposited at the mouth. Geomorphologic evolution in association with the fluvial process of the {LRGR} has received wide attention. The purpose of this study is to investigate the necessary flow to maintain the river mouth open to the Gulf of Mexico using integrated approach of remote sensing and numerical analysis. It also sheds lights on possible solutions in decision-making. The analysis starts with a geomorphologic analysis using satellite remote sensing imagery and historic flow rate assessment, followed by a two-dimensional, depth averaged, finite element numerical modeling analysis to simulate the hydrodynamics of the tidal portion of the {LRGR}. While Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus ({ETM}+) satellite imagery and Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles ({DOQs}) were used for the geomorphologic investigation, Research Management Associates ({RMA}-2) software and Surface Water Modeling System ({SMS} 8.0) were used for minimum stream flow rate analysis. Alternative geomorphic conditions were modeled and compared to the original case, where two simulation runs were established. The first one was designed in dealing with a more refined mesh; and the second was prepared for handling an increased discharge at the inflow boundary along with the investigation of shear stress. The study concludes that the peak shear stress increased with increasing discharge towards the mouth of the river and a 1.27 m3/s discharge is necessary to maintain the opening of the river mouth.},

	abstract = {A flocculent particle transport model was developed to aid in the assessment of particle mediated transport of pollutants in aquatic environments. The model included flocculation driven by binary inter-particle collisions and aggregate breakup driven by particle erosion. A framework was developed in conjunction with the predictive model to synthesize experimental data into the unknown model parameters. The basis of the method lies in the minimization of the variation between model predictions and observations via the iterative numerical determination of the functional minima of a residual function with respect to the parameters being determined. Model parameters have been estimated successfully for analytical and numerical solutions to dispersive, advective-dispersive and flocculent particle transport model equations. The effect of sampling or measurement error and initial parameter estimates on algorithm performance has been evaluated. This approach has been successfully applied to determine data requirements and constraints (quantity, quality and location) for measurement of hydrodynamic and transport characteristics of dye clouds and cohesive aquatic particles in laboratory mixed settling columns. A sensitivity analysis on limited particle size category resolution indicates that particle water column residence times may be significantly overestimated using distributions of less than 8 categories. A computer automated mixed settling column, designed to characterize the vertical transport of suspended particulate material in turbulent aquatic environments, was constructed to verify and calibrate the flocculent transport model within the parameter estimation framework. Dye studies were conducted for hydrodynamic characterization of the column. Continuous transmissometer data taken at various depths in the column were used to extract dispersion coefficients from the dispersive transport model coupled to the parameter estimation framework. Non-flocculent silica particles between 0.5 and 40μm in diameter were used for advection dominant transport studies and column verification. Particle transport studies were conducted on flocculent estuarine sediment particles ranging from 2 to 50μm in diameter. The model was calibrated using time series particle size distributions extracted from samples taken from the column at different depths and times.},

The model input data were obtained from the published on-line data available from various agency and research institutes. The model output consisted of water surface elevation and velocity magnitude. The animation of the water velocity showing the water flow inside the bay was created. The sensitivity analysis on the model showed the response to the various values of input parameters. The most drastic effect on the model was due to the wind stress.

To accomplish this objective, a bench scale filtration apparatus was designed and constructed. Samples collected during the research were analyzed for {TSS}, Fluorescence, and Particle Size Distribution. Parameters measured during this study were flow rate, pressure increase, and media performance. 80\% of {CEO} was removed and a final average {TSS} concentration of 40 mg/L was achieved using a combination of Mixed Media (coarse sand, anthracite and gamet), {PM}-100 ® (anthracite and clay), and activated carbon. Results demonstrated the efficiency of the filtration media in the removal of {CEO} and {TSS}.

	abstract = {A quasi steady state heat transfer computer model was developed to predict heat transfer in the walls of a residential building, on an hourly basis. This model was designed to model the heat transfer of a whole residential building by compiling it with an existing attic transient heat and mass transfer model. This thesis compares the predictions of the computer model with experimental data to determine the validity of the model. This computer model can also be used to estimate the total amount of heat reduction and energy savings in room cooling and heating loads when using radiant barriers. Ambient temperature, hour of the day, and month of the year were input and hourly thermal load calculations were performed using the heat balance approach. Other inputs such as insulation data, ambient temperature, inside room temperature, and air velocity were input to the model. The output of the model recorded the total heat flux on the roof and walls; it also estimated the total amount of heat reduction and energy savings in room heating and cooling produced by the use of radiant barriers. The model predictions were validated by comparing the prediction of the model with experimental values from a test house located at the Texas A\&M University, Kingsville campus. Model differed by 6\% when compared to the experimental data. This model was created to test the performance of radiant barriers more accurately; however, due to lack of time, test on radiant barriers has not been completed. Thus, the model could not be validated nor used for this purpose at the present time. In the future, the model will be used to test radiant barriers. Computer simulations were used to predict the total wall heat flux by taking one year’s ambient temperature data for a fixed location from the Typical Meteorological Year ({TMY}) files. Model also predicted the hourly heat flux data for different insulation levels.},

Simple network represented the dredged channels and the complex networks included the wider and shallow sections. Model sensitivity analysis indicated that the river stretch, due to its depth, lack of vegetation, and sediment-removal, did not offer significant resistance to flow. Wind velocity and direction affected the flow pattern significantly. Tidal influence was considerable and the wider and shallow portions had very little movement. The complex network exhibited some deviations in flow, at certain segments due to the inadequacies of applying a 1-D model to a 2-D system.},

	abstract = {Due to recently enhanced understanding of particle aggregation in aquatic environments, we now have four possible approaches to modeling coagulation: the traditional Euclidean rectilinear, the Euclidean curvilinear, the fractal rectilinear, and the fractal curvilinear approaches. The primary purpose of this research is to investigate which model among these best predicts observations of particle size distribution ({PSD}) and its evolution. In order to do this, two fractal coagulation kinetic models (rectilinear and curvilinear) were developed. The models are generalized models, meaning the Euclidean models are a subset of the fractal models, and have one spatial dimension incorporating sedimentation and vertical dispersion as well as coagulation. The second phase of this work was a comparison of the four models based on a series of observed {PSD} data from a 2-m settling column using estuarine sediment particles. Nonlinear parameter estimation was performed to estimate two free parameters for the fractal models (the fractal dimension, \$D{\textbackslash}{sbF},\$ and the collision efficiency factor, \${\textbackslash}alpha),\$ and one free parameter, \${\textbackslash}alpha,\$ for the Euclidean models. Compared with the observed {PSD}, the simulation showed that the fractal rectilinear model was best among the competing models, and that this model fit better for the larger size particles. The estimated \$D{\textbackslash}{sbF}\$ was between 2.6 and 3.0. The Euclidean curvilinear model underestimated the collision rates even with an α of 1.0, and the resultant fitting was worse than the Euclidean rectilinear case, contrary to the general belief. The research demonstrated that the α’s were calculated to have multiple values, depending on the coagulation models assumed. This finding appears to be significant because α is currently used as a single value based on the conventional Euclidean rectilinear model.},

The behavior of the inorganic species studied, however, such as the total dissolved solids was consistent with the solvent and solute flux predicted by the fundamental diffusion model equations. It appears that organic solute passage and/or rejection involved three possible mechanisms: convection, sieving, and diffusion.},

Each of these hydrologic phenomena was represented by a specific equation. The values of the variable parameters in the equations were determined by sensitivity analysis. After selecting the values of the parameters a quadratic equation was derived. This equation represents the relationship between the depth of water in the channels and the change in the volume of water storage per unit time in the Santa Gertrudis Creek wetlands for the period of February-April. Using the data obtained from the field and the laboratory, the model was run for a year. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a nutrient cycling model of the wetlands.},

	abstract = {In-stream water quality is an important component of watershed management as it defines the intended use. Participatory watershed management involving multiple stakeholders is gaining acceptance for developing waste load allocations ({WLA}). {WLAs} specify the maximum pollutant loadings from permitted compliance systems and are a function of both science and policy. A goal-programming based simulation-optimization approach was developed to assess regional-scale assimilative capacity of a stream. This approach accounts for the heterogeneous nature of the water body regarding flow and non-point source loadings and identifies those sub-regions that are critically stressed. The model was used to develop an optimal loading scheme for the Arroyo Colorado river watershed. A Monte-Carlo reliability analysis was carried out to assess the risks associated with choosing the optimal loading scheme under parametric uncertainty. Ten different models were developed to assess the reliability of the optimal loading scheme under structural uncertainty. The results indicated that San Benito consistently had the highest probability of exceeding the biochemical oxygen demand ({BOD}) standard; similarly, {McAllen} had the highest probability of failing to meet the dissolved oxygen ({DO}) standard in the Arroyo Colorado river watershed. The uncertainties arising from non-point source ({NPS}) estimation schemes were also evaluated and the Modified Rational method provided conservative estimates. Other decision support tools for evaluating various policy options were also developed. A framework for ranking model conceptualizations under stakeholder defined criteria was developed using fuzzy {TOPSIS} technique. The results indicated that inclusion of sediment oxygen demand was important for conservatism. Similarly, the impacts of future urbanization were also evaluated by developing plausible land use land cover projections in {GIS}. Characterizing urbanization was critical for establishing optimal {BOD} loadings regardless of the chosen conceptual model. An integrated probabilistic–fuzzy preference maximization model was developed and illustrated to simultaneously reconcile statistical randomness in biokinetic parameters and vague stakeholder preferences. This model provided equitable loading for each permitted compliance system. The developed decision support system tools are useful for fostering scientifically–credible, risk-informed and consensus-oriented waste load allocation schemes.},

	abstract = {The {EPA} requires in the Final Guidelines for the Certification and Recertification of the Operators of Community and Nontransient Noncommunity Public Water Systems Notice (1999) that states and {US} territories establish some sort of experiential or on-the-job training requirement for incumbent water or wastewater operators before they can legally become licensed professionals. In fact, some states require the operator to possess an adequate amount of experience in real-time plant operations, in order to take the certification exam. However, many times utilities discover that after the duration of training has passed, the would-be operator still does not hold the knowledge needed to pass the certification exam. This presents a well-defined problem when attempting to establish a succession plan for future employment needs, an issue currently plaguing the water industry. A resolution of this issue will involve a training program that seeks to model a mix of educational and experiential components which will produce professionals that have attained sufficient academic and operational expertise. This will require facilitators on each wavelength, academic and industrial, to cooperate in order to achieve the desired outcome. One such program that is currently pursuing such a venture is the Water Training Institute ({WTI}). Created by funds garnered from the Advanced Technological Education ({ATE}) division of the National Science Foundation ({NSF}), the {WTI} program has sought to address the developing workforce needs of the industry by providing pertinent academic training for aspiring operators, all while striving for partnerships with both industrial and regulatory agencies. The {WTI} Steering Committee, a group comprised of educational, industrial, and regulatory experts, epitomizes the necessary cooperation to develop a viable training program. A by-product of such cooperation is a grouping of individual utilities, known as {UNet}, which have agreed to provide the experiential cornerstone of the educational framework by providing internship avenues for student within the {WTI} program. This service ensures that graduates of {WTI} are provided the obligatory experience required for professional licensure. These utilities, in effect, become the instructors of this internship and are given the ability to grade the intern’s performance and to provide an adequate amount of real-life experience to the intern, so that successful simulation of day-to-day operation can occur. Present day evolution of the program has continued by adapting a curricula designed to meet the needs of those who cannot participate in traditional formats. This new format, a modular, self- paced system dissects the original format, breaking the original semester-based format into smaller sub-sections. This grants a greater flexibility to those students that are currently working within the water industry, providing another avenue for a simultaneous educational/experiential curriculum. Interestingly, these internships have harbored not only experience for interns but have in some instances transitioned into fulltime positions with the utilities that have provided the internship.This construct is a win-win scenario for both the utility and student, and would not be possible without sufficient cooperation between all three branches comprising {WTI}.},

Flourometry and {HPLC} were used to quantitate {WAF} concentrations of {PAHs} and {BTEX} respectively. The mechanically dispersed {WAFs} spiked exposure test resulted in a median lethal crude oil loading ({LL}50) = 3914 mg/L compared to a {LL}50 = 2766 mg/L for the continuous exposure assay. This data suggest that spiked exposures require higher {WAF} concentrations to achieve toxic responses similar to those due to continuous exposures. {PAH} data showed some correlation to aquatic toxicity data, while {BTEX} data showed no correlation. Microtox\${\textbackslash}sp{\textbackslash}circler\$ and fluorescence data revealed that chemically dispersed {WAF} {EC}50s were 2 to 29 greater than the mechanically dispersed {WAF} {EC}50s. This suggests that the chemically dispersed {WAFs} have a lower percentage of toxic components per unit concentration that the mechanically dispersed {WAFs}. No significant toxicity variance was observed between the two aquatic test systems and the microbial assay.},

	volume = {10},
	abstract = {With fast population growth and economic development in the {US}-Mexico Borderland, water diversion and usages has reduced the flow substantially in the Low Rio Grande River ({LRGR}). Tidal portion of the {LRGR} has posed an environmental drought issue since 1993 and the channel clogged with the invasion of non-native plants also causes environmental problems. As a result of the intensity of these natural and manmade factors, the Rio Grande stopped flowing to the sea in February 2001. The flows were reduced to a point that they were unable to push out the sand deposited at the mouth. Geomorphologic evolution in association with the fluvial process of the {LRGR} has received wide attention. The purpose of this study is to investigate the necessary flow to maintain the river mouth open to the Gulf of Mexico using integrated approach of remote sensing and numerical analysis. It also sheds lights on possible solutions in decision-making. The analysis starts with a geomorphologic analysis using satellite remote sensing imagery and historic flow rate assessment, followed by a two-dimensional, depth averaged, finite element numerical modeling analysis to simulate the hydrodynamics of the tidal portion of the {LRGR}. While Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus ({ETM}+) satellite imagery and Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles ({DOQs}) were used for the geomorphologic investigation, Research Management Associates ({RMA}-2) software and Surface Water Modeling System ({SMS} 8.0) were used for minimum stream flow rate analysis. Alternative geomorphic conditions were modeled and compared to the original case, where two simulation runs were established. The first one was designed in dealing with a more refined mesh; and the second was prepared for handling an increased discharge at the inflow boundary along with the investigation of shear stress. The study concludes that the peak shear stress increased with increasing discharge towards the mouth of the river and a 1.27 m3/s discharge is necessary to maintain the opening of the river mouth.},

	abstract = {A flocculent particle transport model was developed to aid in the assessment of particle mediated transport of pollutants in aquatic environments. The model included flocculation driven by binary inter-particle collisions and aggregate breakup driven by particle erosion. A framework was developed in conjunction with the predictive model to synthesize experimental data into the unknown model parameters. The basis of the method lies in the minimization of the variation between model predictions and observations via the iterative numerical determination of the functional minima of a residual function with respect to the parameters being determined. Model parameters have been estimated successfully for analytical and numerical solutions to dispersive, advective-dispersive and flocculent particle transport model equations. The effect of sampling or measurement error and initial parameter estimates on algorithm performance has been evaluated. This approach has been successfully applied to determine data requirements and constraints (quantity, quality and location) for measurement of hydrodynamic and transport characteristics of dye clouds and cohesive aquatic particles in laboratory mixed settling columns. A sensitivity analysis on limited particle size category resolution indicates that particle water column residence times may be significantly overestimated using distributions of less than 8 categories. A computer automated mixed settling column, designed to characterize the vertical transport of suspended particulate material in turbulent aquatic environments, was constructed to verify and calibrate the flocculent transport model within the parameter estimation framework. Dye studies were conducted for hydrodynamic characterization of the column. Continuous transmissometer data taken at various depths in the column were used to extract dispersion coefficients from the dispersive transport model coupled to the parameter estimation framework. Non-flocculent silica particles between 0.5 and 40μm in diameter were used for advection dominant transport studies and column verification. Particle transport studies were conducted on flocculent estuarine sediment particles ranging from 2 to 50μm in diameter. The model was calibrated using time series particle size distributions extracted from samples taken from the column at different depths and times.},

	abstract = {The Center for Water Resource Studies and the Bowling Green Community College of Western Kentucky University has formed a partnership to address a Water \& Wastewater Operator/Technician shortage anticipated over the next few years as "Baby Boomers" retire. The Water and Wastewater Technician Training Institute ({WTTI}, pronounced "witty"), is a partnership with the employment sector (a growing number of water \& wastewater utilities/municipalities/districts), state primacy agencies and technical assistance/trade associations to refine an industry needs driven curriculum that utilizes on-line course delivery to provide options for both traditional \& non-traditional students. The partnership is revitalizing an existing Associates Degree program entitled “Water Utilities Management" and integrating 4-year transitions through formal articulation agreements. {WTTI} takes a pedagogical approach to elevating and transforming the water and wastewater operator positions from trades of last resort, to professions of choice, and the integrates practitioners into the recruitment, retention and educational process to achieve a coupled education, training and capacity development environment. A gradual and strategic elevation of the perception, both internal and external, of the trades, through a combination of increased capacity, mobility and accountability will attract high school students whose interests and scholarly record fall between the traditional trades/vocations and academically-based professions, and through inappropriate choices limit their career advancement potential, and elevate skill levels in the critical environmental and public health functions of the water and wastewater utility sector. In order to limit the hurdles associated with integrating regulatory, trade association and academic principles into a single, functional, coherent framework, {WTTI} is initially focused on Kentucky and Tennessee. However, as a demonstrably functional framework is put in place, extrapolating to address other regional policy, academic discipline and industrial sector issues becomes a logistical rather than conceptual challenge. Partnering utilities and municipalities are developing internship and co-operative educational opportunities to ensure work-based experiences for students in the program, while the trade associations have committed to developing scholarship programs to lessen the financial disincentive for potential students. Academic content is provided by core university faculty, while practitioner oriented content will be provided by qualified trade association and utility/municipality staff eligible for adjunct faculty status. Committed to the precept of open-knowledge, {WTTI} is extending and coupling an open-source hybrid practitioner cyber-collaboratory (based on Drupal) with an open-source course management system (Moodle) to integrate the learning environment with practitioners and enhance retention of both students and the retiring practitioner knowledge-base. All instructors (academic and practitioner) involved in the program will undergo collaborative professional development to ensure that they are receptive to the unique structure of the program. All aspects of the program will be available through this on-line environment, allowing current practitioners to participate both as mentors, and as students pursuing career advancement goals. Experiential components of the program include on-line virtual activities, as well as opportunities provided by partnering utilities and municipalities local to the student.},

	abstract = {In response to the needs for long-term water quality monitoring, one of the most significant challenges currently facing the water industry is to investigate the sensor placement strategies with modern concepts of and approaches to risk management. Most of the previous research mainly focuses on using optimization models to deal with small-scale drinking water networks. Yet the challenge of {NP} complete when handling large-scale networks can never be overcome. This study develops a rule-based expert system ({RBES}) to generate sensor deployment strategies with no computational burden as we oftentimes encountered via various types of optimization analyses. Two rules, including the accessibility and complexity rules, were derived to address the characteristics of effectiveness and efficiency required for sensor deployment in these networks. To retrieve the information of population exposure, the well-calibrated {EPANET} model was applied for the vulnerability assessment leading to the derivation of the accessibility rule whereas the graph theory was employed to retrieve the complexity rule eliminating the need to deal with temporal variability. Comparisons between this new expert system and 14 existing optimization and heuristic models confirm that the newly developed expert system in this paper can always compete with most of the optimization models. With no computational burden, the {RBES} that is designed to promote health risk management could also be applicable to deal with similar applications in large-scale drinking water distribution networks.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess feasibility and utility of different uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques in multimedia environmental applications. Sensitivity analysis techniques considered here include Plackett-Burman technique, response-surface methodology, and first order analysis. Uncertainty techniques include Monte-carlo analysis and point estimate method. These techniques were used to propagate uncertainty in these models assuming ±10\% (local scale) and ±50\% (global scale) uncertainty and variability in the inputs. The analysis was carried out for chlorobenzene and Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate ({LAS}) two chemicals exhibiting volatile and non-volatile tendencies respectively. The results indicate that for the conditions employed in this study, all the sensitivity techniques highlighted similar sensitive parameters. Plackett-Burman method is found to be fairly simple tool to identify key inputs, however, it does not account for interaction effects. Fractional factorial method provides this information but it is more complex and time-consuming. Interaction effects can be captured using response-surface method, which is comparatively less complex and hence it may be more preferable in risk-based decision-making. Point estimate method and Monte-Carlo analysis quantify the uncertainty in outputs and give almost similar results. Uncertainty in interactions of inputs is high on global scale for both chemicals, as demonstrated by Monte-Carlo analysis. Monte-Carlo analysis can be applied in combination with first order method to quantify uncertainty in outputs. This information could be useful in risk-based decision-making as the variations in the parameter interactions are significant.},

The primary aim of this project was to determine the feasibility of {BASINS} and {WinHSPF} (Windows interface of {HSPF}) model to assess the water quality of the Lower Rio Grande. {WinHSPF} is a planning level watershed model that integrates both point and non-point sources. The model was developed for the part of the river segment ’Rio Grande below Amistad Reservoir (2304)’ for the years 1993-1994. Existing data was used to calibrate the surface flow. The first step towards determining feasibility of the model i.e. calibration of the surface flow or water balance, was successfully completed. The project demonstrated that by with some limitations, {BASINS} and {WinHSPF} could be applied to the region. It also showed the necessity of more adequate data from U.S. and Mexican side of the river for more accurate results.},

The observed concentrations and pollutant loads of suspended solids were much lower in the runoff of the inlet compared to the outlet for both sites. The {McAuliffe} {RDF} showed better concentration and load reduction for nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, of different species. However, both sites did not show a significant improvement of organic material. In addition, the indicator bacteria concentration represented a fluctuation between the inlet and outlet at each site.},

Source Load Assessment and Management Model for Windows ({WinSLAMM}) was used as the foundation for the {DSS} database and algorithm development. This tool suggested that the implementation of bioswale alone can considerably reduce the footprint and construction cost. Less than 0.95 ha of installation of {BR} and {BS} can mitigate 79\&ndash;91\% of runoff from a maximum of 5 ha of commercial development. A combination of {BR}, {BS}, and {WP} was found to reduce runoff significantly ( 100\%), which suggests that the successful adoption of {DSS} might support better planning of the urban stormwater management in the Lower Rio Grande Valley ({LRGV}).},

The main freshwater sources to the {LLM} flow from the North and Central waterways which are composed of three main waterways: Hidalgo/Willacy Main Drain ({HWMD}), Raymondville Drain ({RVD}) and International Boundary \& Water Commission North Floodway ({IBWCNF}) that are not fully characterized. The objective of this study is to perform a watershed characterization to determine the potential pollution sources of each watershed. The watershed characterization was achieved by developing a cyberinfrastructure and collects a wide inventory of data to identify which one of the three waterways has a major contribution to the {LLM}. Cyberinfrastructure development using the Geographic Information System ({GIS}) database helped to comprehend the major characteristics of each area contributing to the watershed supported by the analysis of the data collected. The watershed characterization process started with delineating the boundaries of each watershed. Then, geospatial and non-geospatial data were added to the cyberinfrastructure from numerous sources including point and non-point sources of pollution. Results showed that {HWMD} and {IBWCNF} watersheds were found to have a higher contribution to the water impairments to the {LLM}. {HWMD} and {IBWCNF} comprise the potential major sources of water quality impairments such as cultivated crops, urbanized areas, on-site sewage facilities, coloinas, and wastewater effluents.},

	abstract = {The overall purpose of this study was to characterize aggregates in terms of fractal dimension, and assess how this fractal dimension, as well as shear rate and Fe({III}) coagulant dose, affect flocculation kinetics. The combination of an electronic particle counter and microscopic imaging techniques provided an accurate means of characterizing experimental flocculation particle size distribution kinetics, as well as aggregate fractal structure. Available particle contact area was assessed on a theoretical basis for numerical models ranging from a coalesced spherical through a full fractal floc assumption. Surface contact area increased by several orders of magnitude as a function of aggregate model complexity. This resulted in a corresponding increase in the number of collisions between particles. A controlled fluid shear dominated hydrodynamic environment was created in which flocculation of algal cells was measured by the fractal dimension of flocs as a function of Fe({III}) coagulant concentration dose. The resultant surface charge was measured as electrophoretic mobility ({EPM}). {EPM} increased from -1.95 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.33 to 0.70 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.51 μm/s/V/cm as coagulant dose increased from 0 to 1.44 mg Fe\${\textbackslash}sp3+\$/L. The {EPM} related to particle concentration, or dilution, as a function of coagulant dose on a log-log basis. {EPM}, fractal dimension, and fractal aggregate particle density all directly related to shear rate, thus supporting a fractal floc assumption. Resulting fractal dimension values were 2.23 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.13 for the lowest velocity gradient of 2 s\${\textbackslash}sp-1\$ and 2.39 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.24 for the highest velocity gradient of 50 s\${\textbackslash}sp-1\$. Therefore shear rate and electrophoretic mobility can be used as flocculation potential and floc fractal dimension indicators. Collision efficiency was determined by a generic parameter estimation algorithm using the monodispersed, polydispersed, and coalesced fractal sphere floc collision frequency functions in a completely mixed flocculation numerical model simulating the batch experimental system. Model results demonstrated the inadequacy of non-fractal formulations to characterize flocculation of low particle concentration (9-15,000/{mL}) systems under moderate fluid shear (2-50 s\${\textbackslash}sp-1\$) conditions. Overall, the flocculation kernel that incorporated fractal floc geometry substantially improved model agreement with observed data over the Euclidean monodispersed and polydispersed assumptions.},

The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission ({TNRCC}) has imposed effluent quality discharge limitations on some of the shrimp farms operating in the South Texas area. Selected water quality parameters of shrimp farms in Rio-Grande valley were studied by research teams from Texas Agriculture Extension Station ({TAES}), Texas A \& M University-Corpus Christi and Texas A \& M University-Kingsville. Results suggests that total suspended solids and nutrients are the major potential pollutants. The values of daily average net increase in {TSS} level in the effluent of Taiwan Shrimp Village Farm ({TSVF}) was about four times higher than the intake concentration during the preharvesting and harvesting seasons. Results indicated lower {TSS} levels during the harvesting season compared to that of the preharvesting season. Increase in levels of nitrite, nitrate, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorous, and reactive phosphorous, in the effluent than their respective concentrations in the intake of the farms during the preharvesting and harvesting periods were also observed. Average concentration of chlorophyll (a) is slightly higher immediately below the farms main discharge in the Arroyo Colorado compared to the intake. During the intensive monitoring period in the harvesting season the effluent coming out of pond ⋕24 ranged between 41 to 945 mg/L, but by the time the effluent reached the individual discharge station {TV}2 the levels have dropped to 62 mg/L. This indicates that the drainage canal might have acted as some kind of settling pond to remove the suspended solids.},

	abstract = {A study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of a treatment strategy to bioremediate weathered Arabian light crude oil in wetland microcosms. A set of eighteen microcosms were constructed with wetland sediment, divided into two treatment sets of nine each, and sampled at three different sampling events–day 0, day 63, and day 106. A precise volume of artificially weathered Arabian light crude oil (corresponding to a sediment concentration of 5μg/g) was spilled in these microcosms. The efficiency of treatment-(({NH}\${\textbackslash}sb4\$)\${\textbackslash}sb3\${PO}\${\textbackslash}sb4\$ + {KNO}\${\textbackslash}sb3\$) was evaluated relative to intrinsic bioremediation. ({NH}\${\textbackslash}sb4\$)\${\textbackslash}sb3\${PO}\${\textbackslash}sb4\$ and {KNO}\${\textbackslash}sb3\$ was added at day 0, and on a weekly basis from day 49 in the treatment set. The sediment cores extruded at the different sampling events were processed for analysis using a {HP} 5980 {GC}/{HP} 5972 Mass spectrometer, and Iatrascan. Overall, the treatment series showed a higher removal of the crude oil, and higher biomass levels compared to the intrinsic series. The study also revealed the relative biodegradability of two isoprenoids–pristane, and phytane. The biomass levels in the treatment series were also a few magnitudes higher in the treatment series. Although the removal of the crude oil cannot be attributed to biodegradation alone, the greater removal of the target compounds and increased biomass levels indicated that the treatment strategy was effective, and hence worthwhile to examine in a meso-scale simulation.},

It was identified that many organic compounds can be mineralized to non-toxic end products by both bacterial and fungal species.

During each experiment, simultaneous determination of Fumonisin removal and microbial biomass growth were made over time. Percent degradation values at the end of each sampling period were obtained by comparing the amount of Fumonisin from test systems with the values from controls. The concentration of Fumonisin was determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography ({HPLC}) and the retention time of Fumonisin was found to be 2.6 min and that the Fumonisin is metabolized into two other compounds. The identification of these compounds is beyond the scope of the present study, and will be determined in future studies. Maximum growth and degradation was observed with microbial isolate 5 at 2 μl volume. In all cases, microbial growth and degradation of Fumonisin seemed to be correlated. An initial lag phase was observed in all microbial isolates and Fumonisin volumes higher than 2 μl.},

	abstract = {Disaster impact assessments are crucial for understanding disasters and effective disaster prevention. Deciding how to respond to disasters cannot be efficient without considering the disaster’s social and economic impacts. Among all types of disasters, drought and flood induce the largest human and economic cost. Interbasin transfer is a commonly used strategy to overcome the mismatch between water availability and water demand, and enhance economic development. The researches present within this dissertation discuss how can we develop an efficient economic impact model or models which can take into consideration sector vulnerability and resiliency strategies in response to extreme climate events, to assist decision makers in devising response strategies. The first and second studies in this dissertation investigate methods to assess the economic consequences of drought induced water restriction and the economic consequences of flood impact in public water supply systems. Drought and flood induce water outage, and cause substantial impacts in public water supply systems. However, researches and tools which assess drought and flood impact in water supply systems are uncommon. We adapt previous work on economic consequence assessment in the event of water services disruption to evaluate the economic impact of water restrictions resulting from extended drought conditions, and water contamination and outage resulting from flood conditions. These two models focus on all commercial and industrial economic sectors across multiple basins using a continuous dynamic social accounting matrix approach.The third study in this dissertation investigates the interbasin transfer impact to the basin(s), with a focus on agriculture production, and discusses the necessity to establish a state-level interbasin transfer regulation in Alabama. A framework for comprehensive impact assessment of interbasin transfer is developed in this dissertation. The interbasin transfer research reviews four representative interbasin transfer projects, concludes the triggers of interbasin transfer projects and impacts in economic, hydrologic, ecological, and social systems. The relation between irrigation and agriculture production is simulated with {AquaCrop}. Three states’ interbasin transfer regulations and acts are studied. Results indicate the required processes to establish a state-level interbasin transfer regulation and the focuses of future researches.},

This study was funded by the Texas On-Site Wastewater Treatment Research Council. Soil type, effluent type and geography were considered in selecting the 18 study sites. Soil and water samples, and other field measurements were taken. Landowners and the county health officers were interviewed to determine the status of on-site systems. The soil was analyzed for texture, swell shrinkage, bulk density and moisture. The effluent was analyzed for {COD}, {BOD} 5 , {pH}, Total Phosphorous, Kjeldahl Nitrogen, Nitrite, Nitrate and Fecal Coliforms. Effluent flow rates were estimated from the number of occupants or bedrooms. The hydraulic conductivity of the soil at different locations in the drip field were determined through permeability tests. A multi-regression analysis was carried out to get the relationship between failure of system, loading rate, and other parameters such as soil type, clay content, and swell shrinkage. Removal efficiencies of the drip system were: {BOD} 5 (56-68\%), {COD} (41-53\%), Fecal coliforms 49.5\%, Total Phosphorous 80.5\%, Nitrite 90.3\%, Total Suspended Solids 95\%.},

	abstract = {The Center for Water Resource Studies and the Bowling Green Community College of Western Kentucky University has formed a partnership to address a Water \& Wastewater Operator/Technician shortage anticipated over the next few years as \&quot;Baby Boomers\&quot; retire. The Water and Wastewater Technician Training Institute ({WTTI}, pronounced \&quot;witty\&quot;), is a partnership with the employment sector (a growing number of water \& wastewater utilities/municipalities/districts), state primacy agencies and technical assistance/trade associations to refine an industry needs driven curriculum that utilizes on-line course delivery to provide options for both traditional \& non-traditional students. The partnership is revitalizing an existing Associates Degree program entitled \&ldquo;Water Utilities Management\&quot; and integrating 4-year transitions through formal articulation agreements. {WTTI} takes a pedagogical approach to elevating and transforming the water and wastewater operator positions from trades of last resort, to professions of choice, and the integrates practitioners into the recruitment, retention and educational process to achieve a coupled education, training and capacity development environment. A gradual and strategic elevation of the perception, both internal and external, of the trades, through a combination of increased capacity, mobility and accountability will attract high school students whose interests and scholarly record fall between the traditional trades/vocations and academically-based professions, and through inappropriate choices limit their career advancement potential, and elevate skill levels in the critical environmental and public health functions of the water and wastewater utility sector. In order to limit the hurdles associated with integrating regulatory, trade association and academic principles into a single, functional, coherent framework, {WTTI} is initially focused on Kentucky and Tennessee. However, as a demonstrably functional framework is put in place, extrapolating to address other regional policy, academic discipline and industrial sector issues becomes a logistical rather than conceptual challenge. Partnering utilities and municipalities are developing internship and co-operative educational opportunities to ensure work-based experiences for students in the program, while the trade associations have committed to developing scholarship programs to lessen the financial disincentive for potential students. Academic content is provided by core university faculty, while practitioner oriented content will be provided by qualified trade association and utility/municipality staff eligible for adjunct faculty status. Committed to the precept of open-knowledge, {WTTI} is extending and coupling an open-source hybrid practitioner cyber-collaboratory (based on Drupal) with an open-source course management system (Moodle) to integrate the learning environment with practitioners and enhance retention of both students and the retiring practitioner knowledge-base. All instructors (academic and practitioner) involved in the program will undergo collaborative professional development to ensure that they are receptive to the unique structure of the program. All aspects of the program will be available through this on-line environment, allowing current practitioners to participate both as mentors, and as students pursuing career advancement goals. Experiential components of the program include on-line virtual activities, as well as opportunities provided by partnering utilities and municipalities local to the student.},

	abstract = {Modeling the transport and fate of spilled crude oil is important for estimating short and long-term toxicity effects in coastal ecosystems. This research project investigates the partitioning of hydrocarbons from a surface crude oil slick, the resurfacing of chemically dispersed crude oil droplets, the suitability of in-situ field instruments for oil and sediment characterization, and the aggregation and settling of dispersed oil and suspended sediments. An initial laboratory study was conducted to investigate apparent hydrocarbon solubility in petroleum/water systems. Mixing shear and initial crude oil layer thickness were related empirically to oil entrainment rate. A model describing hydrocarbons partitioned in colloidal and soluble phases was consistent with experimental data. A second laboratory study was conducted to investigate the influence of coalescence kinetics on mean droplet size and resurfacing rate of chemically dispersed crude oil droplets. Increased mean shear rates resulted in mean droplet diameters and oil resurfacing rates. A third laboratory study was conducted to compare particle size and fractal dimension measurements obtained using a submersible flow cytometer, an electrozone particle counter, and a light scattering particle sizer. Measured particles included latex beads, crude oil, clay, crude oil-clay aggregates, and crude oil-silica aggregates. Tested instruments gave consistent size measurements for all particle systems, suggesting their suitability for sizing marine particles. To describe the aggregation kinetics of oil-sediment systems, a modified Smoluchowski model based on coalesced sphere ({CS}) assumptions was developed. Observed collision efficiency values (α {OBS} ) were related to collision efficiency values for single particle type systems (α {HOMO} ) and those for two particle type systems (α {HET} ) using a probabilistic approach. For clay and crude oil, α {HOMO} values were higher than the α {HOMO} value for silica. Clay-oil and silica-oil have similar α {HET} values. Thus, crude oil can significantly increase the aggregation rates of noncohesive sediments such as silica. The {CS} model above was modified to incorporate sediment fractal geometry. The ability of this modified coalesced fractal sphere ({mCFS}) model to fit experimental data sets was better than that of a coalesced sphere ({CS}) model. Because of their reduced settling rates, sediments with lower fractal dimension form more aggregate with dispersed oil.},

The data show that in the presence of semi-diurnal tide for sand with high porosity the water table in the artificial beach declines gradually with distance from the surf zone. In addition, the water table at a fixed point inside the beach is not sinusoidal although the forcing tide is essentially sinusoidal. This effect is due to the non-linear nature of the problem, which is compensated for, by using relative tidal amplitude and perturbation parameter. The first degree of this correction fits the field data better than Boussinesq’s equation. Similarly, second degree perturbation parameter fits the field data even better for the landward sensors. However, the prediction of model is not exact as the field data because the boundary conditions of model are not appropriate for mesocosm application.},

The analysis of data collected shows that an average of 747 cubic yards/month of the waste were generated against the available dumpster volume capacity of 1756 cubic yards/month. This accounts for only 43\% of the available volume utilization. Of the collected waste, 536 cubic yards/month are recyclable, which is 73\% of the total volume of waste generated. Based on the percentage utilization of total dumpster volumes, it is possible to reduce dumpster volumes by 546 cubic yards/month by decreasing 15 dumpsters and another 84 cubic yards/month by improving the waste collection system, which accounts for 36\% of the total dumpster volumes. Cost analysis shows that after compensating for the cost of the new recycle program, a 20\% reduction in overall waste disposal cost can be achieved. Total elimination of paper towel waste can be achieved by providing hand dryers at all restrooms, which accounts for 10\% of total waste stream. A mathematical model has been developed to predict the quantity of different waste categories generated based on the student and staff population, and number of buildings that are involved in the program. Specific recommendations concerning a midsize university recycling program optimization are provided.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model was developed to predict total petroleum hydrocarbon ({TPH}) degradation in an oilspill impacted inter-tidal wetland system. The whole system was divided into four individual components/compartments, i.e., plant biomass (macrophyte), water column, sediment and rest of the external environment. Thirteen state variables including macrophyte biomass, macrophyte internal nutrients (N\${\textbackslash}sb2\$ \& P), water column and sediment nutrients (N\${\textbackslash}sb2\$, P, {TPH} \& O\${\textbackslash}sb2\$), water column and sediment microorganisms were considered most significant in affecting the performance of the system regarding degradation. Considering different interactions between all 13 state variables as well as some external forcing functions like light, temperature, re-aeration, decay (of microorganisms) etc., different processes were formulated using algebraic expressions. Individual model equations were written to define the time rate changes of each state variable considering all the interactions affecting the variable. A mass balance among the processes was also performed. Field data for most of the state variables were collected from a microcosm study conducted at Texas A\&M University-Kingsville for a period of 105 days. With these data the model was calibrated. The curves showing observed vs. predicted data (except for water column phosphorous) indicated very good prediction and correlation between model results and experimental observations. Taking the calibrated values of the coefficients the model was run for a period of five years. The variation of different state variables over this 5-year period was observed to verify the model. To conduct a sensitivity analysis, five coefficients were selected. Time variations of the state variables due to the change in the coefficient values over a specific range were observed. Arrhenius attenuation factor and maximum specific growth rate of microorganisms in water were observed to be the most sensitive parameter of this model.},

	title = {A Critical Review of the Engineering Service Business Models Employed in Public Works Projects},
	abstract = {Open Source ideals and outcomes are eliciting greater and greater prominence in the software engineering sector. An argument can be made that the basic precepts espoused by the Free Software Foundation should be translatable to all branches of engineering, and in particular to projects directly benefiting the public. The concepts of open source and commercial viability are not mutually exclusive, as evidenced by the so called Red Hat Business Model that has seen much press of late. Of key value in the open source business model is the emphasis on the valuation of effort rather than the restriction of knowledge as the basis of market competitiveness. Further advantages include the more rapid leveraging of new knowledge into better products and services, and an overall lowering of the total cost of ownership or commensurate cost of services to the end user. This paper will provide an in-depth review of the business models employed by Civil/Environmental engineers in both the public and the private sector against a backdrop of public works projects. Included will be an assessment of the increasing role that intellectual property protection plays in market competitiveness of engineering service providers, the effect of proprietary technologies have in shaping the demographics of providers, the role that engineering education has in defining this evolution, and the impact this may have on public infrastructure.},

	rights = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {The Center for Water Resource Studies and the Bowling Green Community College of Western Kentucky University has formed a partnership to address a Water \& Wastewater Operator/Technician shortage anticipated over the next few years as "Baby Boomers" retire. The Water and Wastewater Technician Training Institute ({WTTI}, pronounced "witty"), is a partnership with the employment sector (a growing number of water \& wastewater utilities/municipalities/districts), state primacy agencies and technical assistance/trade associations to refine an industry needs driven curriculum that utilizes on-line course delivery to provide options for both traditional \& non-traditional students. The partnership is revitalizing an existing Associates Degree program entitled “Water Utilities Management" and integrating 4-year transitions through formal articulation agreements. {WTTI} takes a pedagogical approach to elevating and transforming the water and wastewater operator positions from trades of last resort, to professions of choice, and the integrates practitioners into the recruitment, retention and educational process to achieve a coupled education, training and capacity development environment. A gradual and strategic elevation of the perception, both internal and external, of the trades, through a combination of increased capacity, mobility and accountability will attract high school students whose interests and scholarly record fall between the traditional trades/vocations and academically-based professions, and through inappropriate choices limit their career advancement potential, and elevate skill levels in the critical environmental and public health functions of the water and wastewater utility sector. In order to limit the hurdles associated with integrating regulatory, trade association and academic principles into a single, functional, coherent framework, {WTTI} is initially focused on Kentucky and Tennessee. However, as a demonstrably functional framework is put in place, extrapolating to address other regional policy, academic discipline and industrial sector issues becomes a logistical rather than conceptual challenge. Partnering utilities and municipalities are developing internship and co-operative educational opportunities to ensure work-based experiences for students in the program, while the trade associations have committed to developing scholarship programs to lessen the financial disincentive for potential students. Academic content is provided by core university faculty, while practitioner oriented content will be provided by qualified trade association and utility/municipality staff eligible for adjunct faculty status. Committed to the precept of open-knowledge, {WTTI} is extending and coupling an open-source hybrid practitioner cyber-collaboratory (based on Drupal) with an open-source course management system (Moodle) to integrate the learning environment with practitioners and enhance retention of both students and the retiring practitioner knowledge-base. All instructors (academic and practitioner) involved in the program will undergo collaborative professional development to ensure that they are receptive to the unique structure of the program. All aspects of the program will be available through this on-line environment, allowing current practitioners to participate both as mentors, and as students pursuing career advancement goals. Experiential components of the program include on-line virtual activities, as well as opportunities provided by partnering utilities and municipalities local to the student.},

The mesocosm was subjected to a semidiurnal tidal cycle for three months to allow for acclimation prior to testing. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are essential elements for plant growth. Their availability determines the amount of organic matter available to support food webs. For this reason nitrate, phosphorus and total kjeldahl nitrogen were measured in the gravity outflow water, reservoir water and the soil. Biomass, a quantitative measure of the amount of living material present, was monitored in the both the gravity outflow and reservoir water as well as in the plants in the mesocosm. Since microbe biomass in water is difficult to determine, microbial biomass was correlated to total extractable adenosinetriphosphate. The precision of the P-value increased with time for all parameters analyzed across the mesocosm.},

Freundlich and Langmuir Isotherms were evaluated from equilibrium studies on all the three types of soil considering both arsenite and arsenate. Column studies were also conducted on the soils, to simulate the actual field conditions. Three concentrations were considered for the arsenate species. An average concentration was considered for arsenite. Victoria which has more organic, ferrous and clay content had showed the greatest sorption followed by Orelia and Willacy. Sorption of arsenate was greater than arsenite in all types of soils. Increase in sorption of both arsenate and arsenite was observed with increase in initial applied concentration. Break through curves from the column studies, indicated a steady state condition. In Column depth profile studies showed that Orelia and Willacy behaved similarly where as, Victoria had a large drop in arsenic concentration across the profile.},

Laguna Salada was observed to have the maximum visible effect of the bloom during the research study. High biomass levels (up to \$1.88{\textbackslash}times10{\textbackslash}sp7\$/ml) were recorded. The sediment phosphorus levels were observed to be much higher than sediment nitrate levels. The biomass levels were found to show a negative correlation with water nitrate levels (p \${\textless}\$ 0.05) in the area with maximum visible brown tide effect.

Gravity outflow rates, concentrations of nitrates, phosphates, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and biomass were monitored in both the gravity outflow and reservoir water. Redox of the core was monitored at five different depths. The variation in all the parameters narrowed down to statistically tolerable limits across the three treatments during a two month acclimation period.

	abstract = {Modeling the transport and fate of spilled crude oil is important for estimating short and long-term toxicity effects in coastal ecosystems. This research project investigates the partitioning of hydrocarbons from a surface crude oil slick, the resurfacing of chemically dispersed crude oil droplets, the suitability of in-situ field instruments for oil and sediment characterization, and the aggregation and settling of dispersed oil and suspended sediments. An initial laboratory study was conducted to investigate apparent hydrocarbon solubility in petroleum/water systems. Mixing shear and initial crude oil layer thickness were related empirically to oil entrainment rate. A model describing hydrocarbons partitioned in colloidal and soluble phases was consistent with experimental data. A second laboratory study was conducted to investigate the influence of coalescence kinetics on mean droplet size and resurfacing rate of chemically dispersed crude oil droplets. Increased mean shear rates resulted in mean droplet diameters and oil resurfacing rates. A third laboratory study was conducted to compare particle size and fractal dimension measurements obtained using a submersible flow cytometer, an electrozone particle counter, and a light scattering particle sizer. Measured particles included latex beads, crude oil, clay, crude oil-clay aggregates, and crude oil-silica aggregates. Tested instruments gave consistent size measurements for all particle systems, suggesting their suitability for sizing marine particles. To describe the aggregation kinetics of oil-sediment systems, a modified Smoluchowski model based on coalesced sphere ({CS}) assumptions was developed. Observed collision efficiency values (α {OBS} ) were related to collision efficiency values for single particle type systems (α {HOMO} ) and those for two particle type systems (α {HET} ) using a probabilistic approach. For clay and crude oil, α {HOMO} values were higher than the α {HOMO} value for silica. Clay-oil and silica-oil have similar α {HET} values. Thus, crude oil can significantly increase the aggregation rates of noncohesive sediments such as silica. The {CS} model above was modified to incorporate sediment fractal geometry. The ability of this modified coalesced fractal sphere ({mCFS}) model to fit experimental data sets was better than that of a coalesced sphere ({CS}) model. Because of their reduced settling rates, sediments with lower fractal dimension form more aggregate with dispersed oil.},

Surface Water Modeling System ({SMS} 6.0) was used to pre-process and post-process the data. The boundary conditions for the model assigned were the water inflow (upstream boundaries) and water surface elevation (head) specified at the mouth of Baffin Bay, which is the outflow (downstream boundary). The model input data were obtained from the published on-line data available from various agency and research institutes. The model output consisted of water surface elevation and velocity magnitude. The animation of the water velocity showing the water flow inside the bay was created. The sensitivity analysis on the model showed the response to the various values of input parameters. The most drastic effect on the model was due to the wind stress. The model was successfully simulated, however the simulated values could not be verified with data from a different source due to unavailability of such data set.},

Simple network represented the dredged channels and the complex networks included the wider and shallow sections. Model sensitivity analysis indicated that the river stretch, due to its depth, lack of vegetation, and sediment-removal, did not offer significant resistance to flow. Wind velocity and direction affected the flow pattern significantly. Tidal influence was considerable and the wider and shallow portions had very little movement. The complex network exhibited some deviations in flow, at certain segments due to the inadequacies of applying a 1-D model to a 2-D system.},

This model was designed to model the heat transfer of a whole residential building by compiling it with an existing attic transient heat and mass transfer model. This thesis compares the predictions of the computer model with experimental data to determine the validity of the model. This computer model can also be used to estimate the total amount of heat reduction and energy savings in room cooling and heating loads when using radiant barriers. Ambient temperature, hour of the day, and month of the year were input and hourly thermal load calculations were performed using the heat balance approach. Other inputs such as insulation data, ambient temperature, inside room temperature, and air velocity were input to the model. The output of the model recorded the total heat flux on the roof and walls; it also estimated the total amount of heat reduction and energy savings in room heating and cooling produced by the use of radiant barriers. The model predictions were validated by comparing the prediction of the model with experimental values from a test house located at the Texas A\&M University, Kingsville campus. Model differed by 6\% when compared to the experimental data. This model was created to test the performance of radiant barriers more accurately; however, due to lack of time, test on radiant barriers has not been completed. Thus, the model could not be validated nor used for this purpose at the present time. In the future, the model will be used to test radiant barriers. Computer simulations were used to predict the total wall heat flux by taking one year’s ambient temperature data for a fixed location from the Typical Meteorological Year ({TMY}) files. Model also predicted the hourly heat flux data for different insulation levels.},

	abstract = {Due to recently enhanced understanding of particle aggregation in aquatic environments, we now have four possible approaches to modeling coagulation: the traditional Euclidean rectilinear, the Euclidean curvilinear, the fractal rectilinear, and the fractal curvilinear approaches. The primary purpose of this research is to investigate which model among these best predicts observations of particle size distribution ({PSD}) and its evolution. In order to do this, two fractal coagulation kinetic models (rectilinear and curvilinear) were developed. The models are generalized models, meaning the Euclidean models are a subset of the fractal models, and have one spatial dimension incorporating sedimentation and vertical dispersion as well as coagulation. The second phase of this work was a comparison of the four models based on a series of observed {PSD} data from a 2-m settling column using estuarine sediment particles. Nonlinear parameter estimation was performed to estimate two free parameters for the fractal models (the fractal dimension, \$D{\textbackslash}{sbF},\$ and the collision efficiency factor, \${\textbackslash}alpha),\$ and one free parameter, \${\textbackslash}alpha,\$ for the Euclidean models. Compared with the observed {PSD}, the simulation showed that the fractal rectilinear model was best among the competing models, and that this model fit better for the larger size particles. The estimated \$D{\textbackslash}{sbF}\$ was between 2.6 and 3.0. The Euclidean curvilinear model underestimated the collision rates even with an α of 1.0, and the resultant fitting was worse than the Euclidean rectilinear case, contrary to the general belief. The research demonstrated that the α’s were calculated to have multiple values, depending on the coagulation models assumed. This finding appears to be significant because α is currently used as a single value based on the conventional Euclidean rectilinear model.},

The behavior of the inorganic species studied, however, such as the total dissolved solids was consistent with the solvent and solute flux predicted by the fundamental diffusion model equations.

Each of these hydrologic phenomena was represented by a specific equation. The values of the variable parameters in the equations were determined by sensitivity analysis. After selecting the values of the parameters a quadratic equation was derived. This equation represents the relationship between the depth of water in the channels and the change in the volume of water storage per unit time in the Santa Gertrudis Creek wetlands for the period of February-April. Using the data obtained from the field and the laboratory, the model was run for a year. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a nutrient cycling model of the wetlands.},

	abstract = {In-stream water quality is an important component of watershed management as it defines the intended use. Participatory watershed management involving multiple stakeholders is gaining acceptance for developing waste load allocations ({WLA}). {WLAs} specify the maximum pollutant loadings from permitted compliance systems and are a function of both science and policy. A goal-programming based simulation-optimization approach was developed to assess regional-scale assimilative capacity of a stream. This approach accounts for the heterogeneous nature of the water body regarding flow and non-point source loadings and identifies those sub-regions that are critically stressed. The model was used to develop an optimal loading scheme for the Arroyo Colorado river watershed. A Monte-Carlo reliability analysis was carried out to assess the risks associated with choosing the optimal loading scheme under parametric uncertainty. Ten different models were developed to assess the reliability of the optimal loading scheme under structural uncertainty. The results indicated that San Benito consistently had the highest probability of exceeding the biochemical oxygen demand ({BOD}) standard; similarly, {McAllen} had the highest probability of failing to meet the dissolved oxygen ({DO}) standard in the Arroyo Colorado river watershed. The uncertainties arising from non-point source ({NPS}) estimation schemes were also evaluated and the Modified Rational method provided conservative estimates. Other decision support tools for evaluating various policy options were also developed. A framework for ranking model conceptualizations under stakeholder defined criteria was developed using fuzzy {TOPSIS} technique. The results indicated that inclusion of sediment oxygen demand was important for conservatism. Similarly, the impacts of future urbanization were also evaluated by developing plausible land use land cover projections in {GIS}. Characterizing urbanization was critical for establishing optimal {BOD} loadings regardless of the chosen conceptual model. An integrated probabilistic–fuzzy preference maximization model was developed and illustrated to simultaneously reconcile statistical randomness in biokinetic parameters and vague stakeholder preferences. This model provided equitable loading for each permitted compliance system. The developed decision support system tools are useful for fostering scientifically–credible, risk-informed and consensus-oriented waste load allocation schemes.},

	url = {http://ir.ua.edu/handle/123456789/2577},
	abstract = {Research on short lead-time flood inundation and damage assessment traditionally focuses on developing tools for long term planning. Studies that investigate the ability to provide short lead-time analyses are uncommon because of sparcity and spatial inconsistency of short-term hydrologic forecasts. Recent advances in continental scale hydrology make possible the ability to predict discharge at nearly all locations in the conterminous United States ({CONUS}). Theoretically, these discharge outputs enable investigation into the plausibility of short lead-time hydraulic, and damage analyses during flood events. A system predicting the hydraulics and damage potential of floods is only feasible after addressing a number of limitations. For instance, hydraulic models require a characterization of the stream channel, either through site surveys or through approximations. Further, the damage estimation methodology requires building inventories, which are developable by similar mechanisms. This dissertation advances knowledge on how to possibly address these limitations. The first study in this dissertation investigates the use of hydraulic geometries. Hydraulic geometries relate river channel geometry to bankfull discharge. However, the research presented here indicates that hydraulic geometries may estimate both the channel geometry and multiple depths of flow, under certain geomorphic and anthropogenic constraints. Accurate channel geometries are necessary for hydraulic modeling. Depth of flow estimates are useful in developing stage-discharge rating curves and possibly as a standalone means of estimating inundation grids. The second and third studies in this research look to investigate a framework for rapid flood damage assessment using public domain cadastral or parcel geospatial data. The second study discusses a fuzzy logic framework for meshing emergency response Address Points with parcel data and appropriate depth-damage relationships to determine both percent and fiscal impact of flood damage. Results of the second study highlight the effectiveness of determining flood damage with cadastral data using fuzzy text matching. The third study investigates what inputs from the cadastral data are necessary for the fuzzy logic framework to approximate a detailed flood damage investigation. Results indicate that fuzzy logic can approximate a detailed study when provided discrete use descriptions, market value, and square footage.},

	abstract = {Disaster forecasting, warning, recovery, and response in water resources management require the application of knowledge from a diverse range of domains. Identifying the appropriate approach necessitates integrating rules and requirements from these knowledge domains in such a way that the operational goals are achieved with minimally available situational information. Disaster forecasting, warning, recovery, and response must be able to adapt and evolve as new information becomes available. To date, there has been a limited amount of work developing expert systems in this area. In order to fill the knowledge gap, this study 1) identifies and assimilates the knowledge necessary for Water Distribution Network ({WDN}) decontamination, local flood forecasting and warning, and local flood response coordination and training; 2) determines the relative utility of architectures of expert systems and conventional codes; 3) evaluates the relative benefits of forward and backward chaining inferential logic in these scenarios. Based on the outcome of the conceptual systems, we develop three complete backward chaining expert systems, respectively. With extensible knowledge bases combined with the information provided by the users, the expert systems successfully provide reasoning routines, recommendations, and guidance on disaster forecasting, warning, recovery, and response in water resources management.},

Design included selecting the size of the mesocosm and incorporating hydrological and soil features of a wetland environment. The mesocosm was subjected to a semidiurnal tidal cycle for three months to allow for acclimation prior to testing. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are essential elements for plant growth. Their availability determines the amount of organic matter available to support food webs. For this reason nitrate, phosphorus and total kjeldahl nitrogen were measured in the gravity outflow water, reservoir water and the soil. Biomass, a quantitative measure of the amount of living material present, was monitored in the both the gravity outflow and reservoir water as well as in the plants in the mesocosm. Since microbe biomass in water is difficult to determine, microbial biomass was correlated to total extractable adenosinetriphosphate. The precision of the P-value increased with time for all parameters analyzed across the mesocosm.},

Column studies were also conducted on the soils, to simulate the actual field conditions. Three concentrations were considered for the arsenate species. An average concentration was considered for arsenite. Victoria which has more organic, ferrous and clay content had showed the greatest sorption followed by Orelia and Willacy. Sorption of arsenate was greater than arsenite in all types of soils. Increase in sorption of both arsenate and arsenite was observed with increase in initial applied concentration. Break through curves from the column studies, indicated a steady state condition. In Column depth profile studies showed that Orelia and Willacy behaved similarly where as, Victoria had a large drop in arsenic concentration across the profile.},

This research study was aimed at creating an extensive database for the Baffin-Alazan Bay aquatic system for water and sediment quality parameters and their correlation with brown tide persistence. Laguna Salada was observed to have the maximum visible effect of the bloom during the research study. High biomass levels (up to \$1.88{\textbackslash}times10{\textbackslash}sp7\$/ml) were recorded.

The model input data were obtained from the published on-line data available from various agency and research institutes. The model output consisted of water surface elevation and velocity magnitude. The animation of the water velocity showing the water flow inside the bay was created. The sensitivity analysis on the model showed the response to the various values of input parameters. The most drastic effect on the model was due to the wind stress.

	abstract = {A quasi steady state heat transfer computer model was developed to predict heat transfer in the walls of a residential building, on an hourly basis. This model was designed to model the heat transfer of a whole residential building by compiling it with an existing attic transient heat and mass transfer model. This thesis compares the predictions of the computer model with experimental data to determine the validity of the model. This computer model can also be used to estimate the total amount of heat reduction and energy savings in room cooling and heating loads when using radiant barriers. Ambient temperature, hour of the day, and month of the year were input and hourly thermal load calculations were performed using the heat balance approach. Other inputs such as insulation data, ambient temperature, inside room temperature, and air velocity were input to the model. The output of the model recorded the total heat flux on the roof and walls; it also estimated the total amount of heat reduction and energy savings in room heating and cooling produced by the use of radiant barriers. The model predictions were validated by comparing the prediction of the model with experimental values from a test house located at the Texas A\&M University, Kingsville campus. Model differed by 6\% when compared to the experimental data. This model was created to test the performance of radiant barriers more accurately; however, due to lack of time, test on radiant barriers has not been completed. Thus, the model could not be validated nor used for this purpose at the present time. In the future, the model will be used to test radiant barriers. Computer simulations were used to predict the total wall heat flux by taking one year’s ambient temperature data for a fixed location from the Typical Meteorological Year ({TMY}) files. Model also predicted the hourly heat flux data for different insulation levels.},

	abstract = {Due to recently enhanced understanding of particle aggregation in aquatic environments, we now have four possible approaches to modeling coagulation: the traditional Euclidean rectilinear, the Euclidean curvilinear, the fractal rectilinear, and the fractal curvilinear approaches. The primary purpose of this research is to investigate which model among these best predicts observations of particle size distribution ({PSD}) and its evolution. In order to do this, two fractal coagulation kinetic models (rectilinear and curvilinear) were developed. The models are generalized models, meaning the Euclidean models are a subset of the fractal models, and have one spatial dimension incorporating sedimentation and vertical dispersion as well as coagulation. The second phase of this work was a comparison of the four models based on a series of observed {PSD} data from a 2-m settling column using estuarine sediment particles. Nonlinear parameter estimation was performed to estimate two free parameters for the fractal models (the fractal dimension, \$D{\textbackslash}{sbF},\$ and the collision efficiency factor, \${\textbackslash}alpha),\$ and one free parameter, \${\textbackslash}alpha,\$ for the Euclidean models. Compared with the observed {PSD}, the simulation showed that the fractal rectilinear model was best among the competing models, and that this model fit better for the larger size particles. The estimated \$D{\textbackslash}{sbF}\$ was between 2.6 and 3.0. The Euclidean curvilinear model underestimated the collision rates even with an α of 1.0, and the resultant fitting was worse than the Euclidean rectilinear case, contrary to the general belief. The research demonstrated that the α’s were calculated to have multiple values, depending on the coagulation models assumed. This finding appears to be significant because α is currently used as a single value based on the conventional Euclidean rectilinear model.},

The fundamental homogeneous diffusion model for describing membrane systems was the main framework for supporting the hypothesis investigated during this pilot study. It was determined that the heterogeneous nature of dissolved organic carbon in a groundwater source makes it difficult to predict with precision and in a consistent basis the mass transport of organic solute through a semipermeable membrane utilizing the fundamental diffusion model. The behavior of the inorganic species studied, however, such as the total dissolved solids was consistent with the solvent and solute flux predicted by the fundamental diffusion model equations. It appears that organic solute passage and/or rejection involved three possible mechanisms: convection, sieving, and diffusion.},

An one dimensional representation of the wetland surface was selected to develop this model. Precipitation, infiltration, interception, evapotranspiration, flow from an adjacent treatment plant, flow from Santa Gertrudis Creek and the combined outflow from the wetlands are the essential hydrologic phenomena for these wetlands. Each of these hydrologic phenomena was represented by a specific equation. The values of the variable parameters in the equations were determined by sensitivity analysis. After selecting the values of the parameters a quadratic equation was derived. This equation represents the relationship between the depth of water in the channels and the change in the volume of water storage per unit time in the Santa Gertrudis Creek wetlands for the period of February-April. Using the data obtained from the field and the laboratory, the model was run for a year. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a nutrient cycling model of the wetlands.},

	abstract = {In-stream water quality is an important component of watershed management as it defines the intended use. Participatory watershed management involving multiple stakeholders is gaining acceptance for developing waste load allocations ({WLA}). {WLAs} specify the maximum pollutant loadings from permitted compliance systems and are a function of both science and policy. A goal-programming based simulation-optimization approach was developed to assess regional-scale assimilative capacity of a stream. This approach accounts for the heterogeneous nature of the water body regarding flow and non-point source loadings and identifies those sub-regions that are critically stressed. The model was used to develop an optimal loading scheme for the Arroyo Colorado river watershed. A Monte-Carlo reliability analysis was carried out to assess the risks associated with choosing the optimal loading scheme under parametric uncertainty. Ten different models were developed to assess the reliability of the optimal loading scheme under structural uncertainty. The results indicated that San Benito consistently had the highest probability of exceeding the biochemical oxygen demand ({BOD}) standard; similarly, {McAllen} had the highest probability of failing to meet the dissolved oxygen ({DO}) standard in the Arroyo Colorado river watershed. The uncertainties arising from non-point source ({NPS}) estimation schemes were also evaluated and the Modified Rational method provided conservative estimates. Other decision support tools for evaluating various policy options were also developed. A framework for ranking model conceptualizations under stakeholder defined criteria was developed using fuzzy {TOPSIS} technique. The results indicated that inclusion of sediment oxygen demand was important for conservatism. Similarly, the impacts of future urbanization were also evaluated by developing plausible land use land cover projections in {GIS}. Characterizing urbanization was critical for establishing optimal {BOD} loadings regardless of the chosen conceptual model. An integrated probabilistic–fuzzy preference maximization model was developed and illustrated to simultaneously reconcile statistical randomness in biokinetic parameters and vague stakeholder preferences. This model provided equitable loading for each permitted compliance system. The developed decision support system tools are useful for fostering scientifically–credible, risk-informed and consensus-oriented waste load allocation schemes.},

	title = {Rapid flood damage prediction in short lead-time scenarios},
	url = {http://ir.ua.edu/handle/123456789/2577},
	abstract = {Research on short lead-time flood inundation and damage assessment traditionally focuses on developing tools for long term planning. Studies that investigate the ability to provide short lead-time analyses are uncommon because of sparcity and spatial inconsistency of short-term hydrologic forecasts. Recent advances in continental scale hydrology make possible the ability to predict discharge at nearly all locations in the conterminous United States ({CONUS}). Theoretically, these discharge outputs enable investigation into the plausibility of short lead-time hydraulic, and damage analyses during flood events. A system predicting the hydraulics and damage potential of floods is only feasible after addressing a number of limitations. For instance, hydraulic models require a characterization of the stream channel, either through site surveys or through approximations. Further, the damage estimation methodology requires building inventories, which are developable by similar mechanisms. This dissertation advances knowledge on how to possibly address these limitations. The first study in this dissertation investigates the use of hydraulic geometries. Hydraulic geometries relate river channel geometry to bankfull discharge. However, the research presented here indicates that hydraulic geometries may estimate both the channel geometry and multiple depths of flow, under certain geomorphic and anthropogenic constraints. Accurate channel geometries are necessary for hydraulic modeling. Depth of flow estimates are useful in developing stage-discharge rating curves and possibly as a standalone means of estimating inundation grids. The second and third studies in this research look to investigate a framework for rapid flood damage assessment using public domain cadastral or parcel geospatial data. The second study discusses a fuzzy logic framework for meshing emergency response Address Points with parcel data and appropriate depth-damage relationships to determine both percent and fiscal impact of flood damage. Results of the second study highlight the effectiveness of determining flood damage with cadastral data using fuzzy text matching. The third study investigates what inputs from the cadastral data are necessary for the fuzzy logic framework to approximate a detailed flood damage investigation. Results indicate that fuzzy logic can approximate a detailed study when provided discrete use descriptions, market value, and square footage.},

	abstract = {Disaster forecasting, warning, recovery, and response in water resources management require the application of knowledge from a diverse range of domains. Identifying the appropriate approach necessitates integrating rules and requirements from these knowledge domains in such a way that the operational goals are achieved with minimally available situational information. Disaster forecasting, warning, recovery, and response must be able to adapt and evolve as new information becomes available. To date, there has been a limited amount of work developing expert systems in this area. In order to fill the knowledge gap, this study 1) identifies and assimilates the knowledge necessary for Water Distribution Network ({WDN}) decontamination, local flood forecasting and warning, and local flood response coordination and training; 2) determines the relative utility of architectures of expert systems and conventional codes; 3) evaluates the relative benefits of forward and backward chaining inferential logic in these scenarios. Based on the outcome of the conceptual systems, we develop three complete backward chaining expert systems, respectively. With extensible knowledge bases combined with the information provided by the users, the expert systems successfully provide reasoning routines, recommendations, and guidance on disaster forecasting, warning, recovery, and response in water resources management.},

	title = {Creating a Water and Wastewater Educational Program with Incorporated Experiential Training},
	url = {http://www.asee.org/public/conferences/8/papers/5150/download},
	abstract = {The {EPA} requires in the Final Guidelines for the Certification and Recertification of the Operators of Community and Nontransient Noncommunity Public Water Systems Notice (1999) that states and {US} territories establish some sort of experiential or on-the-job training requirement for incumbent water or wastewater operators before they can legally become licensed professionals. In fact, some states require the operator to possess an adequate amount of experience in real-time plant operations, in order to take the certification exam. However, many times utilities discover that after the duration of training has passed, the would-be operator still does not hold the knowledge needed to pass the certification exam. This presents a well-defined problem when attempting to establish a succession plan for future employment needs, an issue currently plaguing the water industry. A resolution of this issue will involve a training program that seeks to model a mix of educational and experiential components which will produce professionals that have attained sufficient academic and operational expertise. This will require facilitators on each wavelength, academic and industrial, to cooperate in order to achieve the desired outcome. One such program that is currently pursuing such a venture is the Water Training Institute ({WTI}). Created by funds garnered from the Advanced Technological Education ({ATE}) division of the National Science Foundation ({NSF}), the {WTI} program has sought to address the developing workforce needs of the industry by providing pertinent academic training for aspiring operators, all while striving for partnerships with both industrial and regulatory agencies. The {WTI} Steering Committee, a group comprised of educational, industrial, and regulatory experts, epitomizes the necessary cooperation to develop a viable training program. A by-product of such cooperation is a grouping of individual utilities, known as {UNet}, which have agreed to provide the experiential cornerstone of the educational framework by providing internship avenues for student within the {WTI} program. This service ensures that graduates of {WTI} are provided the obligatory experience required for professional licensure. These utilities, in effect, become the instructors of this internship and are given the ability to grade the intern’s performance and to provide an adequate amount of real-life experience to the intern, so that successful simulation of day-to-day operation can occur. Present day evolution of the program has continued by adapting a curricula designed to meet the needs of those who cannot participate in traditional formats. This new format, a modular, self- paced system dissects the original format, breaking the original semester-based format into smaller sub-sections. This grants a greater flexibility to those students that are currently working within the water industry, providing another avenue for a simultaneous educational/experiential curriculum. Interestingly, these internships have harbored not only experience for interns but have in some instances transitioned into fulltime positions with the utilities that have provided the internship.This construct is a win-win scenario for both the utility and student, and would not be possible without sufficient cooperation between all three branches comprising {WTI}.},

	volume = {10},
	abstract = {With fast population growth and economic development in the {US}-Mexico Borderland, water diversion and usages has reduced the flow substantially in the Low Rio Grande River ({LRGR}). Tidal portion of the {LRGR} has posed an environmental drought issue since 1993 and the channel clogged with the invasion of non-native plants also causes environmental problems. As a result of the intensity of these natural and manmade factors, the Rio Grande stopped flowing to the sea in February 2001. The flows were reduced to a point that they were unable to push out the sand deposited at the mouth. Geomorphologic evolution in association with the fluvial process of the {LRGR} has received wide attention. The purpose of this study is to investigate the necessary flow to maintain the river mouth open to the Gulf of Mexico using integrated approach of remote sensing and numerical analysis. It also sheds lights on possible solutions in decision-making. The analysis starts with a geomorphologic analysis using satellite remote sensing imagery and historic flow rate assessment, followed by a two-dimensional, depth averaged, finite element numerical modeling analysis to simulate the hydrodynamics of the tidal portion of the {LRGR}. While Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus ({ETM}+) satellite imagery and Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles ({DOQs}) were used for the geomorphologic investigation, Research Management Associates ({RMA}-2) software and Surface Water Modeling System ({SMS} 8.0) were used for minimum stream flow rate analysis. Alternative geomorphic conditions were modeled and compared to the original case, where two simulation runs were established. The first one was designed in dealing with a more refined mesh; and the second was prepared for handling an increased discharge at the inflow boundary along with the investigation of shear stress. The study concludes that the peak shear stress increased with increasing discharge towards the mouth of the river and a 1.27 m3/s discharge is necessary to maintain the opening of the river mouth.},

	abstract = {A flocculent particle transport model was developed to aid in the assessment of particle mediated transport of pollutants in aquatic environments. The model included flocculation driven by binary inter-particle collisions and aggregate breakup driven by particle erosion. A framework was developed in conjunction with the predictive model to synthesize experimental data into the unknown model parameters. The basis of the method lies in the minimization of the variation between model predictions and observations via the iterative numerical determination of the functional minima of a residual function with respect to the parameters being determined. Model parameters have been estimated successfully for analytical and numerical solutions to dispersive, advective-dispersive and flocculent particle transport model equations. The effect of sampling or measurement error and initial parameter estimates on algorithm performance has been evaluated. This approach has been successfully applied to determine data requirements and constraints (quantity, quality and location) for measurement of hydrodynamic and transport characteristics of dye clouds and cohesive aquatic particles in laboratory mixed settling columns. A sensitivity analysis on limited particle size category resolution indicates that particle water column residence times may be significantly overestimated using distributions of less than 8 categories. A computer automated mixed settling column, designed to characterize the vertical transport of suspended particulate material in turbulent aquatic environments, was constructed to verify and calibrate the flocculent transport model within the parameter estimation framework. Dye studies were conducted for hydrodynamic characterization of the column. Continuous transmissometer data taken at various depths in the column were used to extract dispersion coefficients from the dispersive transport model coupled to the parameter estimation framework. Non-flocculent silica particles between 0.5 and 40μm in diameter were used for advection dominant transport studies and column verification. Particle transport studies were conducted on flocculent estuarine sediment particles ranging from 2 to 50μm in diameter. The model was calibrated using time series particle size distributions extracted from samples taken from the column at different depths and times.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess feasibility and utility of different uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques in multimedia environmental applications. Sensitivity analysis techniques considered here include Plackett-Burman technique, response-surface methodology, and first order analysis. Uncertainty techniques include Monte-carlo analysis and point estimate method. These techniques were used to propagate uncertainty in these models assuming ±10\% (local scale) and ±50\% (global scale) uncertainty and variability in the inputs. The analysis was carried out for chlorobenzene and Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate ({LAS}) two chemicals exhibiting volatile and non-volatile tendencies respectively. The results indicate that for the conditions employed in this study, all the sensitivity techniques highlighted similar sensitive parameters. Plackett-Burman method is found to be fairly simple tool to identify key inputs, however, it does not account for interaction effects. Fractional factorial method provides this information but it is more complex and time-consuming. Interaction effects can be captured using response-surface method, which is comparatively less complex and hence it may be more preferable in risk-based decision-making. Point estimate method and Monte-Carlo analysis quantify the uncertainty in outputs and give almost similar results. Uncertainty in interactions of inputs is high on global scale for both chemicals, as demonstrated by Monte-Carlo analysis. Monte-Carlo analysis can be applied in combination with first order method to quantify uncertainty in outputs. This information could be useful in risk-based decision-making as the variations in the parameter interactions are significant.},

	abstract = {Regarding the purification of seawater, it is necessary to reduce both the total concentration of salt and also the concentration of boron to meet purity requirements for safe drinking water. For this purpose reverse osmosis membrane modules can be designed based on experimental data supported by computer models to determine energy efficient configurations and operating conditions. In previous studies numerical models have been suggested to predict the performance of the removal with respect to difference pressures, {pH} values, and temperatures. Here, an analytical model is suggested which allows for both the simplified fitting of the parameters required for predicting boron transport coefficients and also the simple equations that can be used for the design of combined seawater and boron removal systems. This modelling methodology is demonstrated through two case studies including {FilmTec} and Saehan membrane modules. For both cases the model is shown to be able to predict the performance with similar accuracy compared with existing finite-difference type numerical models from the literature.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to provide preliminary exploration of how corporate social responsibility issues are currently reported and communicated by {US} major casino companies. Empirical evidence is drawn from standalone {CSR} reports and websites of the 30 largest casino companies in the {US}, which is explored through content analysis methodology. This paper finds that there are substantial variations in the reporting and communication of {CSR} issues by casino companies. While casino companies mainly rely on websites to communicate {CSR} issues, 23\% of the sample companies use standalone {CSR} reports. Whereas websites tend to provide relatively limited information about {CSR} activities, standalone {CSR} reports have a tendency to cover comprehensive {CSR} themes in a detailed manner. In addition, the content analysis based on website reveals that while most casino companies tend to be passive about responsible gaming, some are trying to behave more actively and responsibly about this issue.},

	abstract = {Effective water quality management requires careful consideration of pollutant fate and transport, proper estimation of non-point source loadings, and maximum allowable allocation of point source discharges. A decision support system ({DSS}) that addresses all these issues is developed in this study by embedding mass-balance expressions, {GIS}, and a remote-sensing-based non-point source loading scheme into a hybrid goal-programming approach and is applied to the rapidly growing Arroyo Colorado River watershed along the {US}–Mexico border. The model components were favorably evaluated against field data and previous studies. The {DSS} was used to evaluate the carrying capacity of the river, defined based on the water quality standards for biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, and minimum in-stream flow requirements. The results indicated that on a macro-scale, the current stresses utilize about 40 \% of the maximum carrying capacity. However, the most upstream and downstream sub-watersheds are currently over stressed and need to reduce their loadings. The assimilative capacity of the river is not sufficient to carry current flows at their permitted discharge concentrations implying an inequity among discharges with regard to treatment cost burden. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the carrying capacity was more affected by policy choices made for water quality standards then where they were to be enforced (i.e., compliance locations). Urban areas currently cover 13 \% of the watershed but contribute nearly 45 \% of the total non-point source loadings. Therefore, the urbanization in this watershed must be carefully planned with emphasis on stormwater treatment and management to sustain this valuable resource for future generations.},
